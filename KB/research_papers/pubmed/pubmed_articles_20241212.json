    "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a complex condition marked by insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. Traditional dietary interventions, such as low-calorie or low-carbohydrate diets, typically overlook individual variability in postprandial glycemic responses (PPGRs), which can lead to suboptimal management of the disease. Recent advancements suggest that personalized nutrition, tailored to individual metabolic profiles, may enhance the effectiveness of T2D management.",

    "abstract": "Managing Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMDs) at risk for hypoglycemia, such as Glycogen Storage Diseases (GSDs), Hereditary Fructose Metabolism Disorders (HFMDs) and Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CH), poses challenges in dietary treatments and blood glucose monitoring. The effectiveness of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) remains a subject of ongoing debate, with IMD guidelines maintaining caution. Therefore, a systematic evaluation is needed to understand the potential benefits of CGM during dietary interventions. A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed according to the PICOS model and PRISMA recommendations on studies published from January 01, 2003, up to October 15, 2023 (PROSPERO CRD42024497744). The risk of bias was assessed using NIH Quality Assessment Tools. Twenty-four studies in GSDs (n\u2009=\u200913), CH (n\u2009=\u200910), and HFMDs (n\u2009=\u20091) were analyzed. In GSDs, Real-time CGM (Rt-CGM) was associated with metabolic benefits during nutritional interventions, proving to be an accurate system for hypoglycemia detection although with some concerns about reliability. Rt-CGM in CH, primarily involving children, also showed potential benefits for glycemic control and metabolic stability with acceptable accuracy, although its use during dietary changes was limited. Few experiences on Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) were reported, with some concerns about reliability. Overall, the studies analyzed presented different designs, and their quality was predominantly fair or poor. Heterogeneity and limited consensus on reliability and glycemic targets underscore the need for prospective studies and future recommendations for the use of CGM in optimizing nutritional status and providing personalized dietary education in individuals with IMDs prone to hypoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "Obesity stands out as a primary risk factor for diabetes. Attaining healthy weight loss, especially reducing body fat, is important in managing prediabetes and preventing progression to full diabetes and its co-morbidities. This study examined the effects of personalized nutrition therapy (PNT) combined with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on body weight and composition in individuals with prediabetes. A total of 30 individuals with prediabetes who were overweight or obese were assigned randomly to either the treatment, observed CGM data plus PNT, or the control group which was blinded to their blood glucose results throughout the study. Both groups were provided with dietary recommendations for calorie intake and macronutrient distribution, coupled with personalized goal setting for glucose control and healthy eating, without any specific emphasis on weight reduction or changes in physical activity. Regular visits were scheduled every 10 days to perform measurements and replace CGMs. Data were analyzed using General Linear Model with repeated measures. Over the 30-day follow-up period, both groups experienced significant reductions in weight and fat mass. The treatment group exhibited two-fold greater reductions in both weight and fat mass, a significant decrease in carbohydrate intake, and a significant increase in time spent on physical activitycompared to the control group. In addition, compliance was notably higher in the treatment group. These findings indicate that overweight or obese individuals with prediabetes can achieve weight loss and improved body composition through personalized education for glucose control, without exclusively emphasizing weight loss as the primary objective. Additionally, the real-time feedback provided by CGM enhances these improvements.",

    "abstract": "Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived metrics have been used to accurately assess glycemic variability (GV) to facilitate management of diabetes mellitus, yet their relationship with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is not fully understood. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between GV metrics and the risk of developing DPN. Nine studies totaling 3,649 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. A significant association was found between increased GV, as indicated by metrics including standard deviation (SD) with OR and 95% CI of 2.58 (1.45-4.57), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) with OR and 95% CI of 1.90 (1.01-3.58), mean of daily difference (MODD) with OR and 95% CI of 2.88 (2.17-3.81) and the incidence of DPN. Our findings support a link between higher GV and an increased risk of DPN in patients with diabetes. These findings highlight the potential of GV metrics as indicators for the development of DPN, advocating for their inclusion in diabetes management strategies to potentially mitigate neuropathy risk. Longitudinal studies with longer observation periods and larger sample sizes are necessary to validate these associations across diverse populations.",

    "title": "Recommendations for recognizing, risk stratifying, treating, and managing children and adolescents with hypoglycemia.",
    "abstract": "There has been continuous progress in diabetes management over the last few decades, not least due to the widespread dissemination of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and automated insulin delivery systems. These technological advances have radically changed the daily lives of people living with diabetes, improving the quality of life of both children and their families. Despite this, hypoglycemia remains the primary side-effect of insulin therapy. Based on a systematic review of the available scientific evidence, this paper aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for recognizing, risk stratifying, treating, and managing patients with hypoglycemia. The objective of these recommendations is to unify the behavior of pediatric diabetologists with respect to the timely recognition and prevention of hypoglycemic episodes and the correct treatment of hypoglycemia, especially in patients using CGM or advanced hybrid closed-loop systems. All authors have long experience in the specialty and are members of the Italian Society of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology. The goal of treating hypoglycemia is to raise blood glucose above 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and to prevent further decreases. Oral glucose at a dose of 0.3 g/kg (0.1 g/kg for children using \"smart pumps\" or hybrid closed loop systems in automated mode) is the preferred treatment for the conscious individual with blood glucose <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), although any form of carbohydrate (e.g., sucrose, which consists of glucose and fructose, or honey, sugary soft drinks, or fruit juice) containing glucose may be used. Using automatic insulin delivery systems, the oral glucose dose can be decreased to 0.1 g/kg. Practical flow charts are included to aid clinical decision-making. Although representing the official position of the Italian Society of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology (ISPED), these guidelines are applicable to the global audience and are especially pertinent in the era of CGM and other advanced technologies.",

    "abstract": "Expert guidelines recommend an aerobic cooldown to lower blood glucose for the management of post-exercise hyperglycemia. This strategy has never been empirically tested. Our aim in this study was to compare the glycemic effects of performing an aerobic cooldown vs not performing a cooldown after a fasted resistance exercise session. We hypothesized that the cooldown would lower blood glucose in the 30 minutes after exercise and would result in less time in hyperglycemia in the 6 hours after exercise.",

Compared to noncaregiving grandparents, custodial grandparents report poorer mental and physical health and stronger changes in daily well-being when experiencing negative and positive events. We examine whether an online social intelligence training (SIT) program improves custodial grandmothers' (CGM) daily well-being, socioemotional skills, and changes in well-being when confronted with daily negative and positive events.",

    "title": "Remote ischemic conditioning improves cerebral hemodynamics in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis: A PET/CT-guided randomized controlled study.",
    "abstract": "Patients with symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis (sICAS) suffer embarrassed hemodynamic status and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) recurrence. We aimed to assess the efficacy of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) on improving this status by evaluating cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral glucose metabolism (CGM) via PET/CT. Adult patients with unilateral sICAS in middle cerebral artery and/or intracranial segment of internal carotid artery-related AIS or transient ischemic attack within 6\u2009months prior to randomization were enrolled. Individuals who received intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment, or sICAS caused by cardiac embolism, small vessel occlusion, or other determined causes were excluded. Twenty-three eligible patients were randomly assigned to standard medical treatment (SMT) (n\u2009=\u200910) or RIC group (n\u2009=\u200913). The RIC protocol consisted of 5\u2009cycles, each for 5-min bilateral upper limb ischemia and 5-min reperfusion period, twice a day, with a total duration of 3\u2009months. Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled as healthy control group. We tested CBF and CGM at the rest stage and the methazolamide-induced stress stage. All patients received PET/CT at baseline and three-month followup. Both CBF and CGM in ipsilateral hemisphere of sICAS patients were significantly decreased at the rest stage and the stress stage (p\u2009<\u2009.05), which were improved by three-month RIC (p\u2009<\u2009.05). The lesions decreased notably in RIC group compared to SMT group (p\u2009<\u2009.05). RIC ameliorated the hemodynamic status and glucose metabolism in regions at high risk of infarction, which might improve the resistance capacity towards ischemic load in sICAS patients.",

    "abstract": "YG1699 is a novel inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) and SGLT2. This double-blind, 3-way crossover trial compared YG1699 to dapagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on insulin pump therapy. Treatment periods included four mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTTs) and insulin withdrawal tests per person. Nineteen adults with T1D were randomized to YG1699 10\u2009mg, YG1699 25\u2009mg, and dapagliflozin 10\u2009mg once daily for 1 week in different orders. The primary end point was the difference in area under the curve (AUC) in plasma glucose (AUC",

    "abstract": "Multiple automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have become commercially available following randomised controlled trials demonstrating benefits in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, their real-world utility may be undermined by user-associated burdens, including the need to carbohydrate count and deliver manual insulin boluses. There is an important need for a 'fully automated closed loop' (FCL) AID system, without manual mealtime boluses. The (Closed Loop Open SourcE In Type 1 diabetes) trial is a randomised trial comparing an FCL AID system to the same system used as a hybrid closed loop (HCL) in people with T1D, in an outpatient setting over an extended time frame.",

The aim of this study was to investigate glucose metrics during a one-week low-carbohydrate-high-fat (HF) and a low-carbohydrate-high-protein (HP) diet compared with an isocaloric high-carbohydrate (HC) diet. In a randomized, three-period cross-over study, twelve adults with insulin-pump-treated type 1 diabetes followed an HC (energy provided by carbohydrate: 48%, fat: 33%, protein: 19%), HF (19%, 62%, 19%), and an HP (19%, 57%, 24%) diet for one week. Glucose values were obtained during intervention periods using a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring system. Participant characteristics were: 33% females, median (range) age 50 (22-70) years, diabetes duration 25 (11-52) years, HbA1c 7.3 (5.5-8.3)% (57 (37-67) mmol/mol), and BMI 27.3 (21.3-35.9) kg/m",

    "abstract": "Vigorous intermittent exercise can improve indices of glycemia in the 24\u00a0h postexercise period in apparently healthy individuals. We examined the effect of a single session of bodyweight exercise (BWE) on glycemic responses using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) under controlled dietary conditions. Healthy inactive adults (n\u2009=\u200927; 8 males, 19 females; age: 23\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u00a0years) completed 2 virtually supervised trials spaced\u2009~\u20091\u00a0week apart in a randomized, crossover manner. The trials involved an 11-min BWE protocol that consisted of 5\u2009\u00d7\u20091-min bouts performed at a self-selected pace interspersed with 1-min active recovery periods or a non-exercise sitting control period (CON). Mean heart rate during the BWE protocol was 147\u2009\u00b1\u200914 beats per min (75% of age-predicted maximum). Mean 24\u00a0h glucose after BWE and CON was not different (5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 vs 5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00a0mM respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.39). There were also no differences between conditions for measures of glycemic variability or the postprandial glucose responses after ingestion of a 75\u00a0g glucose drink or lunch, dinner, and breakfast meals. This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting a remotely supervised BWE intervention using CGM under free-living conditions. Future studies should investigate the effect of repeated sessions of BWE training or responses in people with impaired glycemic control.",

    "abstract": "Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) have been proved a promising clinical strategy for the treatment of diabetes, and time in range (TIR) has been demonstrated a new metric of glycemic control links to diabetes complications. To further assess the therapeutic effect of UC-MSCs on TIR, a phase II study investigating the efficacy of UC-MSCs in Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) assessed by retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was conducted. In this randomized and placebo-controlled trial, a total of 73 patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous infusion of UC-MSCs (n\u2005=\u200537) or placebo (n\u2005=\u200536) 3 times at 4-week intervals and followed up for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the changes in TIR and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). TIR and HbA1c were both significantly improved in UC-MSCs and placebo groups after 48 weeks of therapy compared with baseline. Compared with placebo group, UC-MSCs group exhibited more pronounced changes at 9 and 48 weeks from baseline in TIR (26.54 vs. 15.84 and 21.36 vs. 6.32) and HbA1c (-1.79 vs. -0.96 and -1.36 vs. -0.51). More patients in UC-MSCs group achieved the glycemic control target of TIR\u2005\u2265\u200570% and HbA1c\u2005<\u20057% at 9 and 48 weeks than in placebo group (59.5% vs. 27.8% and 43.2% vs. 11.1%). The C-peptide area under the curve (AUCC-pep) was an independent risk factor associated with efficacy in T2D undergoing UC-MSCs intervention. These results illustrate that UC-MSCs administration via intravenous infusion is an effective approach for ameliorating TIR.",

Eleven randomized-controlled trials were included with a total of 570 patients, from a total of 869 articles found adhering to PRISMA guidelines. The efficacy of the therapies were evaluated from the day, night and during physical activities monitoring of the of the mean blood glucose (BG), Time In Range (TIR), and Standard Deviation (SD) of the glucose variability. The safety measure of the therapies, was assessed from the day and night recording of the hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events occurred. Pooled results of comparison of mean BG values for day, night and physical activities, -\u00a04.33 [-\u00a06.70, -\u00a01.96] (P\u2009=\u20090.0003), -\u00a016.61 [-\u00a031.68, -\u00a01.54] (P\u2009=\u20090.03) and -\u00a08.27 [-\u00a019.52, 2.99] (P\u2009=\u20090.15).

In adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (T2D), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and flash glucose monitoring (FGM) do not decrease symptomatic hypoglycemia episodes (strength of recommendation [SOR], B) but do lower time in hypoglycemia (SOR, C; disease-oriented evidence).CGM, in which glucose levels are sent automatically in numeric and graphic format to a patient's smart device for their potential action, did not change the hypoglycemic event rate (SOR, B; 2 prospective studies). CGM significantly reduced hypoglycemia duration in an 8-month randomized controlled trial (RCT; SOR, C) but not in a 1-year prospective study (SOR, C).FGM, in which glucose levels are sent on demand to a device, did not significantly reduce hypoglycemic episodes (SOR, B; 1 small RCT and 1 prospective study). Hypoglycemia duration was reduced significantly with FGM in a 6-month RCT (SOR, B) but not in a 1-year prospective study (SOR, B).",

    "abstract": "Non-severe hypoglycemia (NS-H) is challenging for people living with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D) and often results from relative iatrogenic hyper-insulinemia. Current guidelines recommend a one-size-fits-all approach of 15-20 g of simple carbohydrates (CHO) every 15\u00a0min regardless of the triggering conditions of the NS-H event. We aimed to test different amounts of CHO to treat insulin-induced NS-H at various glucose ranges.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in clinical care has led to more optimal glycemic and quality-of-life outcomes, compared with multiple daily injections (MDI). Despite this, some insulin pump users revert back to MDI. The aim of this review was to include the most recent rates of insulin pump discontinuation among people with type 1 diabetes and to identify reasons for and factors associated with discontinuation. A systematic literature search was conducted using the Embase.com, MEDLINE (via OVID), PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. Titles and abstracts of eligible publications were screened, and baseline characteristics of the included studies were extracted, as were variables in the context of insulin pump use. Data were synthesized into themes: indications for insulin pump initiation, persons with type 1 diabetes (PWD)-reported reasons for, and factors associated with insulin pump discontinuation. A total of 826 eligible publications were identified and 67 were included. Discontinuation percentages ranged from 0% to 30% (median 7%). The most frequently mentioned reasons for discontinuation were wear-related issues (e.g., device attached to the body, interference with daily activities, discomfort, affected body image). Related factors included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (17%), issues with following treatment recommendations (14%), age (11%), gender (9%), side effects (7%), and comorbidity- and complication-related factors (6%). Despite many developments in insulin pump technology, discontinuation rates and PWD-reported reasons for and factors associated with insulin pump discontinuation in more recent studies were comparable to earlier reviews/meta-analyses. Continuation of insulin pump treatment depends on a knowledgeable and willing health care provider (HCP) team and a close match with PWDs' wishes and needs.",

Since 90s, exogenous PTH is also available, but a not negligible number of patients experience a poor control.

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the published data about continuous subcutaneous PTH infusion in chronic hypoPTH patients and achieve conclusions for clinical practice.",

In case of device malfunction, the BP generates and continuously updates backup insulin doses for injection or pump users, including long-acting insulin dose, a four-period basal insulin profile, short-acting meal doses, and a glucose correction factor. Following a 13-week trial in type 1 diabetes, participants using the BP (6-83 years) completed 2-4 days, in which they were randomly assigned to their prestudy insulin regimen (",

However, data collected on the same individual tend to be similar (yielding correlated or dependent data) and require analyses that take into account that correlation. Many opt for simplified techniques such as calculating one measure from the data collected and analyse one observation per subject. These simplified methods may yield inconsistent and biased results in some instances. In this systematic review, we aim to examine the adequacy of the statistical analyses performed in such studies and make recommendations for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid closed loop (HCL) systems are the combination of a pump for insulin delivery and a glucose sensor for continuous glucose monitoring. These systems are managed by an algorithm, which delivers insulin on the basis of the interstitial glucose levels. The MiniMed\u2122 670G system was the first HCL system available for clinical purpose. In this paper, we reviewed the literature about metabolic and psychological outcomes in children, adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes treated with MiniMed\u2122 670G. Only 30 papers responded to the inclusion criteria and thus were considered. All the papers show that the system is safe and effective in managing glucose control. Metabolic outcomes are available up to 12\u00a0months of follow-up; longer study period are lacking. This HCL system may improve HbA1c up to 7.1% and time in range up to 73%. The time spent in hypoglycaemia is almost neglectable. Better improvement in blood glucose control is observed in patients with higher HbA1c at HCL system start and larger daily use of auto-mode functionality. \u00a0 \u00a0 Conclusion: The Medtronic MiniMed\u2122 670G is safe and well accepted, without any increase in the burden for patients. Some papers report an improvement in the psychological outcomes, but other papers do not confirm this finding. So far, it significantly improves the management of diabetes mellitus in children, adolescents and young adults. Proper training and support by the diabetes team are mandatory. Studies for a period longer than 1\u00a0year would be appreciated to better understand the potentiality of this system. What is Known: \u2022 The Medtronic MiniMed",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the effect of high protein breakfast diet with or without lunch on the postprandial glucose level during the day. A randomized, crossover design that recruited 12 healthy young participants (three men and nine women) was performed and four trials (normal breakfast + skipped lunch, high protein breakfast + skipped lunch, normal breakfast + lunch, and high protein breakfast + lunch) were conducted in two weeks. During each trial, breakfast, lunch, and dinner on the trial day, and dinner before the trial day, were provided as test meals, and the meal timing was fixed. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was used to assess the blood glucose level during the whole experiment. Incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of the postprandial glucose level was calculated. The results suggested that compared with normal breakfast, high protein breakfast suppressed the 3 h iAUC of postprandial glucose level after breakfast (p < 0.05 or p < 0.0001) and 1.5 h iAUC after lunch (p < 0.01). During lunch, high protein breakfast diet suppressed the dinner and overall day postprandial glucose level (p < 0.05 vs. normal breakfast), but no significant difference was observed when skipping lunch. Our findings indicate that high protein breakfast could suppress the breakfast postprandial glucose level, as well as following lunch and dinner, but this effect on dinner was attenuated when skipping lunch.",

    "abstract": "The central role of pancreas in glucose regulation imposes high demands on perioperative glucose management in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. In a post hoc subgroup analysis of a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the perioperative use of subcutaneous (SC) fully closed-loop (FCL; CamAPS HX) versus usual care (UC) insulin therapy in patients undergoing partial or total pancreatic resection. Glucose control was compared using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics (% time with CGM values between 5.6 and 10.0\u2009mmol/L and more). Over the time of hospitalization, FCL resulted in better glucose control than UC with more time spent in the target range 5.6-10.0\u2009mmol/L (mean [standard deviation] % time in target 77.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6% and 41.1%\u2009\u00b1\u200919.5% in FCL vs. UC subjects, respectively; mean difference 36.6% [95% confidence interval 18.5-54.8]), without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Findings suggest that an adaptive SC FCL approach effectively accommodated the highly variable insulin needs in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery.

These systems use a control algorithm that automatically modifies the amount of insulin infused into a patient based on real-time blood glucose measurements. This study presents a summary of key clinical and technical issues related to the development of the first commercial AID systems and their evolution into commercial biomedical devices.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing postprandial blood glucose (PPG) levels after mixed meals that contain high fat and protein remains a challenge in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. This study evaluated the efficacy of different algorithms used for dosing insulin based on counting units of high fat and high protein (HFHP) meals with the current conventional method of counting carbohydrates alone to control PPG excursions. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane electronic databases were searched, with the analysis restricted to randomized control trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was the PPG (mean and standard deviation) at 240\u2009min. The pooled final estimate was the mean difference (MD) of the PPGs at 240\u2009min using random effect models to account for heterogeneity. In total, 15 studies were identified and included in the systemic review, of which 12 were RCTs, and three studies were non-randomized trials. The pooled MD of the PPG at 240\u2009min was in favor of additional insulin doses in HFHP meals compared to the carbohydrate counting alone. The statistically significant results favored the combined bolus (30:70) that split over 2\u00a0h in insulin pump therapy with pooled MD of the PPG, 240\u2009min of -24.65; 95% CI: -36.59, -8.41; and heterogeneity, 0%. Other statistically significant results favored the additional insulin added to insulin to carb ratio (ICR) of meal bolus (25-60% ICR) in multiple daily injections therapy with the pooled MD of PPG at 240\u2009min, -21.71; 95% CI: -38.45, -4.73; and heterogeneity, 18%. Insulin treatment based on fat and protein content, in addition to carbohydrate counting, is more effective than the carbohydrate counting method alone; however, further research is warranted to determine the best equation for fat and protein counting, particularly in people with multiple daily injections.",

    "abstract": "Ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor, in combination with prednisone and abiraterone, is under evaluation for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Hyperglycemia is an on-target effect of ipatasertib. An open-label, single-arm, single-sequence, signal-seeking study (n\u00a0=\u00a025 mCRPC patients) was conducted to evaluate the glucose changes across four different treatment periods: ipatasertib alone, ipatasertib-prednisone combination, ipatasertib-prednisone-abiraterone combination (morning dose), and ipatasertib-prednisone-abiraterone combination (evening dose). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was used in this study to compare the dynamic glucose changes across the different treatment periods. Four key parameters: average glucose, peak glucose and % time in range (70-180 and >180\u2009mg/dl) were evaluated for this comparison. Ipatasertib-prednisone-abiraterone combination when administered in the morning after an overnight fast significantly increased average glucose, peak glucose and % time in range >180\u2009mg/dl\u00a0compared to ipatasertib monotherapy. Ipatasertib, when co-administered with abiraterone, increased ipatasertib and M1 (G-037720) metabolite exposures by approximately 1.5- and 2.2-fold, respectively. Exposure-response analysis results show that increased exposures of ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone are associated with increased glucose levels. When ipatasertib-prednisone-abiraterone combination was administered as an evening dose compared to a morning dose, lowered peak glucose and improved % time in range was observed. The results from this study suggest that dosing ipatasertib after an evening meal followed by overnight fasting can be an effective strategy for managing increased glucose levels.",

    "abstract": "Hyperglucagonemia contributes to hyperglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D); however, novel therapeutics that block glucagon action could improve glycemic control. This phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of volagidemab, an antagonistic monoclonal glucagon receptor (GCGR) antibody, as an adjunct to insulin therapy in adults with T1D. The primary endpoint was change in daily insulin use at week 12. Secondary endpoints included changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 13, in average daily blood glucose concentration and time within target range as assessed by continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) and seven-point glucose profile at week 12, incidence of hypoglycemic events, the proportion of subjects who achieve HbA1c reduction of \u22650.4%, volagidemab drug concentrations and incidence of anti-drug antibodies. Eligible participants (n\u2009=\u200979) were randomized to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of placebo, 35\u2009mg volagidemab or 70\u2009mg volagidemab. Volagidemab produced a reduction in total daily insulin use at week 12 (35\u2009mg volagidemab: -7.59\u2009units (U) (95% confidence interval (CI) -11.79, -3.39; P\u2009=\u20090.040 versus placebo); 70\u2009mg volagidemab: -6.64\u2009U (95% CI -10.99, -2.29; P\u2009=\u20090.084 versus placebo); placebo: -1.27\u2009U (95% CI -5.4, 2.9)) without meeting the prespecified significance level (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.025). At week 13, the placebo-corrected reduction in HbA1c percentage was -0.53 (95% CI -0.89 to -0.17, nominal P\u2009=\u20090.004) in the 35\u2009mg volagidemab group and -0.49 (95% CI -0.85 to -0.12, nominal P\u2009=\u20090.010) in the 70\u2009mg volagidemab group. No increase in hypoglycemia was observed with volagidemab therapy; however, increases in serum transaminases, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and blood pressure were observed. Although the primary endpoint did not meet the prespecified significance level, we believe that the observed reduction in HbA1c and tolerable safety profile provide a rationale for further randomized studies to define the long-term efficacy and safety of volagidemab in patients with T1D.",

    "abstract": "Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is rapidly becoming a vital tool in the management of type 1 diabetes. Its use has been shown to improve glycaemic management and reduce the risk of hypoglycaemic events. The cost of CGM remains a barrier to its widespread application. We aimed to identify and synthesize evidence about the cost-effectiveness of utilizing CGM in patients with type 1 diabetes. Studies were identified from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library from January 2010 to February 2022. Those that assessed the cost-effectiveness of CGM compared to self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) in patients with type 1 diabetes and reported lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were included. Studies on critically ill or pregnant patients were excluded. Nineteen studies were identified. Most studies compared continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and SMBG to a sensor-augmented pump (SAP). The estimated ICER range was [$18,734-$99,941] and the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain range was [0.76-2.99]. Use in patients with suboptimal management or greater hypoglycaemic risk revealed more homogenous results and lower ICERs. Limited studies assessed CGM in the context of multiple daily injections (MDI) (n\u00a0=\u00a04), MDI and SMBG versus SAP (n\u00a0=\u00a02) and three studies included hybrid closed-loop systems. Most studies (n\u00a0=\u00a017) concluded that CGM is a cost-effective tool. This systematic review suggests that CGM appears to be a cost-effective tool for individuals with type 1 diabetes. Cost-effectiveness is driven by reducing short- and long-term complications. Use in patients with suboptimal management or at risk of severe hypoglycaemia is most cost-effective.",

    "abstract": "Associations of mean glucose and time in range (70-180\u2009mg/dL) from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with HbA1c in adults with type 2 diabetes are not well characterized. We conducted a secondary analysis of 186 participants from the Hyperglycemic Profiles in Obstructive Sleep Apnea (HYPNOS) trial. Participants simultaneously wore Dexcom G4 and Abbott Libre Pro CGM sensors up to 4 weeks. Mean HbA1c was 7.7% (SD, 1.3). There were strong negative Pearson's correlations of HbA1c with CGM time in range (-0.79, Abbott; -0.81, Dexcom) and strong positive correlations with CGM mean glucose (Dexcom, 0.84; Abbott, 0.82). However, there were large differences in CGM mean glucose (\u00b120\u2009mg/dL) and time in range (\u00b114%) at any given HbA1c value. Mean glucose and HbA1c are strongly correlated in type 2 diabetes patients not taking insulin but discordance is evident at the individual level. Clinicians should expect discordance and use HbA1c and CGM in a complementary manner. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02454153.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with lower scores on tests of cognitive and neuropsychological function and alterations in brain structure and function in children. This proof-of-concept pilot study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03428932) examined whether MRI-derived indices of brain development and function and standardized IQ scores in adolescents with T1D could be improved with better diabetes control using a hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system. Eligibility criteria for participation in the study included age between 14 and 17 years and a diagnosis of T1D before 8 years of age. Randomization to either a hybrid closed-loop or standard diabetes care group was performed after pre-qualification, consent, enrollment, and collection of medical background information. Of 46 participants assessed for eligibility, 44 met criteria and were randomized. Two randomized participants failed to complete baseline assessments and were excluded from final analyses. Participant data were collected across five academic medical centers in the United States. Research staff scoring the cognitive assessments as well as those processing imaging data were blinded to group status though participants and their families were not. Forty-two adolescents, 21 per group, underwent cognitive assessment and multi-modal brain imaging before and after the six month study duration. HbA1c and sensor glucose downloads were obtained quarterly. Primary outcomes included metrics of gray matter (total and regional volumes, cortical surface area and thickness), white matter volume, and fractional anisotropy. Estimated power to detect the predicted treatment effect was 0.83 with two-tailed, \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. Adolescents in the hybrid closed-loop group showed significantly greater improvement in several primary outcomes indicative of neurotypical development during adolescence compared to the standard care group including cortical surface area, regional gray volumes, and fractional anisotropy. The two groups were not significantly different on total gray and white matter volumes or cortical thickness. The hybrid closed loop group also showed higher Perceptual Reasoning Index IQ scores and functional brain activity more indicative of neurotypical development relative to the standard care group (both secondary outcomes). No adverse effects associated with study participation were observed. These results suggest that alterations to the developing brain in T1D might be preventable or reversible with rigorous glucose control. Long term research in this area is needed.",

    "title": "Evaluation of Clinical Metrics for Identifying Defective Physiologic Responses to Hypoglycemia in Long-Standing Type 1 Diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Repeated hypoglycemia exposure leads to impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) and the development of defective counterregulatory responses. To date, only pancreas or islet transplantation has demonstrated normalization of hypoglycemia awareness and the endogenous glucose production (EGP) response to defend against insulin-induced hypoglycemia in long-standing type 1 diabetes (T1D). This study aims to validate clinical metrics of IAH (Clarke score), hypoglycemia severity (HYPO score), glycemic lability (lability index), and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) as predictors of absent autonomic symptom (AS) recognition and defective glucose counterregulation during insulin-induced hypoglycemia, thus enabling early identification of individuals with compromised physiologic defense against clinically significant hypoglycemia. Forty-three subjects with mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation age 43\u2009\u00b1\u200913 years and T1D duration 28\u2009\u00b1\u200913 years, including 32 with IAH and 11 with hypoglycemia awareness (Aware), and 12 nondiabetic control subjects, underwent single-blinded randomized-paired hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hypoglycemic clamp experiments. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess metric prediction of absent AS recognition and defective EGP responses to hypoglycemia. Clarke score and CGM measures of hypoglycemia exposure demonstrated good ability to predict absent AS recognition (area under the curve \u22650.80). A composite threshold of IAH-Clarke \u22654 with ROC curve-derived thresholds for CGM measures of hypoglycemia exposure showed high specificity and predictive value in identifying an absent AS response during the hypoglycemic clamp. Metrics demonstrated poor ability to predict defective glucose counterregulation by the EGP response, which was impaired even in the Aware group. Screening for IAH alongside assessment of CGM data can increase the specificity for identifying individuals with absent hypoglycemia symptom recognition who may benefit from further intervention.",

We assessed the prevalence of CAN and the association between glucose variability (GV) and cardiovascular autonomic function in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and IAH. This study is a post-hoc-analysis of results obtained with the IN-CONTROL-trial, designed to assess the effects of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on glycaemia. Forty participants (aged 46.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4\u00a0years, diabetes duration 29.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.5\u00a0years, HbA1c 7.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8%(58.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8\u00a0mmol/mol)) underwent 2-week blinded CGM measurements to obtain GV indices. Standardized cardiovascular reflex tests were used to determine the presence of CAN. Cardiovascular autonomic function was assessed with heart rate variability (HRV) measures. 14(35%) participants were classified as having CAN. Participants with CAN had lower percentage time spent in hypoglycaemic range and low blood glucose index(LBGI). After correction for confounders, a significant positive association was found between the coefficient of variation (CV) or time spent in hypoglycaemic range and HRV measures SDRR or RMSSD, and between LBGI and RMSSD. In patients with T1DM and IAH, hypoglycaemic parameters were associated with better cardiovascular autonomic function and lower prevalence of CAN. This suggests that autonomic neuropathy does not seem to further deteriorate hypoglycaemic risk in patients with IAH.",

    "abstract": "Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) represents an integral of modern diabetes management, however, there is still a lack of sensor performance data when rapidly consuming different liquids and thus changing total body water. 18 healthy adults (ten females, age: 23.1 \u00b1 1.8 years, BMI 22.2 \u00b1 2.1 kg\u00b7m\u22122) performed four trial visits consisting of oral ingestion (12 mL per kg body mass) of either a 0.9% sodium chloride, 5% glucose or Ringer\u2019s solution and a control visit, in which no liquid was administered (control). Sensor glucose levels (Dexcom G6, Dexcom Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were obtained at rest and in 10-min intervals for a period of 120 min after solution consumption and compared against reference capillary blood glucose measurements. The overall MedARD [IQR] was 7.1% [3.3\u221210.8]; during control 5.9% [2.7\u221210.8], sodium chloride 5.0% [2.7\u221210.2], 5% glucose 11.0% [5.3\u221221.6] and Ringer\u2019s 7.5% [3.1\u221213.2] (p < 0.0001). The overall bias [95% LoA] was 4.3 mg\u00b7dL\u22121 [\u221219 to 28]; during control 3.9 mg\u00b7dL\u22121 [\u221211 to 18], sodium chloride 4.8 mg\u00b7dL\u22121 [\u22129 to 19], 5% glucose 3.6 mg\u00b7dL\u22121 [\u221233 to 41] and Ringer\u2019s solution 4.9 mg\u00b7dL\u22121 [\u221213 to 23]. The Dexcom G6 CGM system detects glucose with very good accuracy during liquid solution challenges in normoglycemic individuals, however, our data suggest that in people without diabetes, sensor performance is influenced by different solutions.",

    "abstract": "Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) have improved the management of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), with glucose oxidase (GOx)-based sensors being the most used. However, they are potentially subject to both electrochemical and enzymatic interferences, including those related to changes of pH. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of ethanol, given as beer along with a mixed meal, on the accuracy of a commercial GOx-CGM. Data from 12 T1D participants in a randomized crossover trial to evaluate the effect of meal composition and alcohol consumption on postprandial glucose concentration were used. Absolute error (AE) and mean absolute relative difference (MARD) were calculated. The differences between the alcohol and nonalcohol scenarios were assessed using the Mann\u2212Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The AE in the alcohol study was low, but significantly greater as compared to the study without alcohol (p-value = 0.0418). The MARD was numerically but not significantly greater. However, both variables were greater at pH < 7.36 and significantly affected by time only in the alcohol arm. In T1D, alcohol consumption affects the accuracy of a GOx-CGM. This effect could be at least partially related to the ethanol-induced changes in pH.",

    "abstract": "The first two studies of an artificial pancreas (AP) system carried out in Latin America took place in 2016 (phase 1) and 2017 (phase 2). They evaluated a hybrid algorithm from the University of Virginia (UVA) and the automatic regulation of glucose (ARG) algorithm in an inpatient setting using an AP platform developed by the UVA. The ARG algorithm does not require carbohydrate (CHO) counting and does not deliver meal priming insulin boluses. Here, the first outpatient trial of the ARG algorithm using an own AP platform and doubling the duration of previous phases is presented.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of closed-loop insulin system (CLS) in non-pregnant patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using systematic review and meta-analysis. A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on long-term use (not less than 8 weeks) of CLS in patients with T1DM were selected. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan V.5.3.5 to compare CLS with controls (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with blinded continuous glucose monitoring or unblinded sensor-augmented pump therapy or multiple daily injections or predictive low-glucose suspend system) in adults and children with type 1 diabetes. Research quality evaluation was conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Eleven RCTs (817 patients) that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with controls, the CLS group had a favorable effect on the proportion of time with sensor glucose level in 3.9-10\u2009mmol/L (10.32%, 8.70% to 11.95%), above 10\u2009mmol/L (-8.89%, -10.57% to -7.22%), or below 3.9\u2009mmol/L (-1.09%, -1.54% to -0.64%) over 24 hours. The CLS group also had lower glycated hemoglobin levels (-0.30%, -0.41% to -0.19%), and glucose variability, coefficient of variation of glucose, and SD were lower by 1.41 (-2.38 to -0.44, p=0.004) and 6.37\u2009mg/dL (-9.19 mg/dL to -3.55\u2009mg/dL, p<0.00001). There were no significant differences between the CLS and the control group in terms of daily insulin dose, quality of life assessment, and satisfaction with diabetes treatment. CLS is a better solution than control treatment in optimizing blood glucose management in patients with T1DM. CLS could become a common means of treating T1DM in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic, multifactorial metabolic disease that requires constant medical care. T1DM is the result of an irreversible destruction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells, inevitably leading individuals to chronic exogenous insulin dependence. The prevalence of depression among T1DM is common and affects both the progression and management of the disease. The aim of this study is to present the depressive symptoms in people with T1DM who apply and those who do not apply the insulin pump therapy method and to highlight differences in terms of gender and age. The literature review was conducted using the databases PubMed, Science-Direct and Scopus. The inclusion criteria were the following: the studies had to be conducted in T1DM patients, study depressive symptomatology, the number of participants in the studies to be more than 70 people and to be in English. Initially, 464 articles were retrieved and 11 articles met the requirements for inclusion in the systematic review. The results of the systematic review, excluding paediatric patients with T1DM, showed that patients who apply the insulin pump therapy method were more likely to have higher prevalence and intensity of depressive symptoms, compared to users of multiple daily injections. Respectively, increased depressive symptoms in women with T1DM were presented, regardless of the method of treatment. Factors that mediate this difference in depressive symptoms are the sense of freedom and flexibility in lifestyle, fewer dietary restrictions, the sense of constant \"bonding\" and social stigma. Finally, mental health professionals should frequently evaluate the depressive symptoms of the T1DM patients, as it has a direct impact on the development and management of the disease.",

In a 6-month RCT, 112 subjects were randomly assigned to closed-loop control (Tandem Control-IQ) after obtaining 2 weeks of baseline Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from sensor-augmented pump therapy. We compared glycemic outcomes from baseline to end of study among subgroups classified by baseline HbA1c levels. All HbA1c subgroups showed an improvement in TIR due to reduction of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Those with HbA1c <6.5% improved mostly by reducing nocturnal hypoglycemia due to the automated basal insulin adjustments. Those with HbA1c \u22658.5% improved mostly by reducing daytime and nocturnal hyperglycemia due to both automated basal insulin adjustments and correction boluses during the day. There does not appear to be any reason to exclude individuals with T1D from automated insulin delivery based on their HbA1c. Clinical Trial Identifier: NCT03563313.",

    "abstract": "Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived time in range (TIR) correlates with hemoglobin A1c (A1c) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, there is a paucity of data evaluating its association with microvascular complications. We conducted this systematic review to examine the association between TIR and microvascular complications of diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). We conducted a comprehensive literature search on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science online databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Full-text original articles that evaluated the association between CGM-derived TIR and risk of microvascular complications and were published between 2010 and June 2021 were included in our systematic review. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Data were analyzed using qualitative synthesis. Eleven studies on a total of 13\u2009987 patients were included in the systematic review. The median sample size, baseline A1c, and diabetes duration were 466 patients (range: 105-5901), 8.2% (SD 0.5%), and 11.3 years (1.0), respectively. Majority of the studies were conducted in Asia (10 out of 11). Four studies evaluated the relationship between CGM-derived TIR and DR and CGM-derived TIR and DN, while seven studies evaluated the relationship between CGM-derived TIR and DPN. A 10% increase in TIR was associated with a reduction in albuminuria, severity of DR, and prevalence of DPN and cardiac autonomic neuropathy. In addition, an association was observed between urinary albumin to creatinine ratio but not with estimated glomerular filtration rate. This review summarizes recent evidence supporting an association between CGM-derived TIR and microvascular complications among patients with T2DM. A larger-scale multicenter investigation that includes more diverse participants is warranted to further validate the utility of TIR as a predictor of diabetic microvascular complications.",

However, few studies have profiled the post-prandial glycemic response (PPGR) in younger children. The aim of this study was to assess PPGR to breakfast interventions differing in GI in healthy children aged 5-7 years. Eleven subjects completed an open-label, randomized, cross-over trial, receiving three equicaloric test beverages (260 kcal) consisting of 125 mL semi-skimmed milk and 50 g sugar (either glucose, sucrose, or isomaltulose). On a fourth occasion, the sucrose beverage was delivered as intermittent supply. PPGR was measured over 180 min using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). The incremental area under the curve (3h-iAUC) was highest for the glucose beverage, followed by intermittent sucrose (-21%, ",

    "abstract": "Unhealthy eating habits are associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and increased insulin resistance in young patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and may impact the possible benefit from dietary interventions on glycaemic control. This study determines how nutritional patterns influence the quality of dietary intervention with a 30% or 50% carbohydrate diet in terms of glycaemic control measured with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Eating habits were obtained with a frequency-of-consumption questionnaire (FFQ-6) before the diet assessment. Altogether, we collected CGM and FFQ-6 data from 30 children (16 boys and 14 girls aged 10-17 years) with T1DM subjected to two consecutive 3-day nutritional plans. From these, 23 patients met the CGM data quality criteria for further analysis. Furthermore, high accuracy achieved in training (95.65%) and V-fold cross-validation (81.67%) suggest a significant impact of food habits in response to introduced nutritional changes. Patients who consumed more vegetables or grains (>4 times per day), more wheat products (>once per day), fewer fats (<1.5 times per day), and ranked fruit juice as the most common selection in the drinks category achieved glycaemic control more often after the introduction of a 30% carbohydrate diet, as opposed to those with different dietary patterns, whose glycaemic control was negatively impacted after switching to this diet. Additionally, the 50% carbohydrate diet was safe for all patients in the context of glycaemic control.",

    "abstract": "Due to its simplicity, time-limited eating (TLE) may represent a more feasible approach for treating adolescents with obesity compared to other caloric restriction regimens. This pilot study examines the feasibility and safety of TLE combined with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in adolescents. Fifty adolescents with BMI \u226595th percentile were recruited to complete a 12-week study. All received standard nutritional counseling, wore a CGM daily, and were randomized to: (1) Prolonged eating window: 12 h eating/12 h fasting + blinded CGM; (2) TLE (8 h eating/16 h fasting, 5 days per week) + blinded CGM; (3) TLE + real-time CGM feedback. Recruitment, retention, and adherence were recorded as indicators of feasibility. Weight loss, dietary intake, physical activity, eating behaviors, and quality of life over the course of the intervention were explored as secondary outcomes. Forty-five participants completed the study (16.4 \u00b1 1.3 years, 64% female, 49% Hispanic, 75% public insurance). There was high adherence to prescribed eating windows (TLE 5.2 d/wk [SD 1.1]; control 6.1 d/wk [SD 1.4]) and daily CGM wear (5.85 d/wk [SD 4.8]). Most of the adolescents (90%) assigned to TLE reported that limiting their eating window and wearing a CGM was feasible without negative impact on daily functioning or adverse events. There were no between-group difference in terms of weight loss, energy intake, quality of life, physical activity, or eating behaviors. TLE combined with CGM appears feasible and safe among adolescents with obesity. Further investigation in larger samples, with a longer intervention duration and follow-up assessments are needed.",

    "title": "The Role of Protein and Fat Intake on Insulin Therapy in Glycaemic Control of Paediatric Type 1 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Research Gaps.",
    "abstract": "Carbohydrate counting (CHC) is the established form of calculating bolus insulin for meals in children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). With the widespread use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) observation time has become gapless. Recently, the impact of fat, protein and not only carbohydrates on prolonged postprandial hyperglycaemia have become more evident to patients and health-care professionals alike. However, there is no unified recommendation on how to calculate and best administer additional bolus insulin for these two macronutrients. The aim of this review is to investigate: the scientific evidence of how dietary fat and protein influence postprandial glucose levels; current recommendations on the adjustment of bolus insulin; and algorithms for insulin application in children with T1DM. A PubMed search for all articles addressing the role of fat and protein in paediatric (sub-)populations (<18 years old) and a mixed age population (paediatric and adult) with T1DM published in the last 10 years was performed. Conclusion: Only a small number of studies with a very low number of participants and high degree of heterogeneity was identified. While all studies concluded that additional bolus insulin for (high) fat and (high) protein is necessary, no consensus on when dietary fat and/or protein should be taken into calculation and no unified algorithm for insulin therapy in this context exists. A prolonged postprandial observation time is necessary to improve individual metabolic control. Further studies focusing on a stratified paediatric population to create a safe and effective algorithm, taking fat and protein into account, are necessary.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the influence of Jinlida granules on glycemic variability with or without metformin treatment in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. This study was a 16-week, double-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The enrolled patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into four groups: control, Jinlida, metformin, and combination treatment groups. A retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system was used for subcutaneous interstitial glucose monitoring for 3 days consecutively. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), traditional Chinese medicine symptom score, and CGM parameters, including glucose coefficient of variation, standard deviation of blood glucose values, and time in range of glucose 3.9-10.0 mmol/L, were assessed pre-test and post-test. A total of 138 participants completed the entire procedure. Compared with the pre-test, fasting plasma glucose, 2 hour postprandial plasma glucose, HbA1c, and traditional Chinese medicine symptom score all decreased in the four groups at the end of the test, and the combination treatment group showed the most significant decrease. In terms of CGM parameters, time in range of the Jinlida and metformin groups improved after intervention compared with the baseline (Jinlida group: 78.68 \u00b1 26.15 versus 55.47 \u00b1 33.29; metformin group: 87.29 \u00b1 12.21 vs. 75.44 \u00b1 25.42; P < 0.01). Additionally, only the Jinlida group showed decreased glucose standard deviation after intervention (1.57 \u00b1 0.61 vs. 1.96 \u00b1 0.95; P < 0.01). Jinlida granules can improve glycemic control and glycemic variability in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. ",

Several literature methods were proposed to adjust the standard formula (SF) used for insulin bolus calculation by accounting for glucose ROC, but each of them provides different suggestions, making it difficult to understand which should be applied in practice.

    "abstract": "The current study explored pre-pandemic sociodemographics, medical characteristics, social/family support, and mood symptoms, and current COVID-19 experiences as predictors of mood, positive/negative diabetes-specific experiences, and COVID-19-specific distress among parents of children with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that parents from marginalized backgrounds, youth with higher pre-pandemic A1c and no CGM use, parents with lower pre-pandemic\u00a0social/family support and more pre-pandemic mood/anxiety symptoms, and those with more negative COVID-19 experiences would have more depressive symptoms, fewer positive and more negative diabetes-specific experiences, and more COVID-19-specific distress during the initial months of the pandemic.",

We performed a comprehensive systematic review of recent clinical trials and evidence that could be applicable in real-world practice and suitable for the Korean population. The guideline is provided for all healthcare providers including physicians, diabetes experts, and certified diabetes educators across the country who manage patients with diabetes or the individuals at the risk of developing diabetes mellitus. The recommendations for screening diabetes and glucose-lowering agents have been revised and updated. New sections for continuous glucose monitoring, insulin pump use, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with diabetes mellitus have been added. The KDA recommends active vaccination for coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with diabetes during the pandemic. An abridgement that contains practical information for patient education and systematic management in the clinic was published separately.",

    "abstract": "To observe whether different insulin glargine titration algorithms based on fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels lead to different glycaemic variations (GVs) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, a prospective, randomized, single-centre, comparative, three-arm parallel-group, open-label, treat-to-target, 24-week study was performed. A total of 71 uncontrolled T2D patients were recruited and randomized 1\u2009:\u20093\u2009:\u20093 into Groups 1, 2, and 3 (insulin titration goals of FBG \u2264 5.6, \u22646.1, and \u22647.0) for this study. The initiated insulin glargine dose was recommended at 0.2\u2009U/kg/day and was then titrated following the FBG target. Patients were subjected to two 3-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) at baseline and the endpoint, wherein the CGM data were analysed, and the study's primary endpoint was the difference in 24\u2009hrs mean amplitude of glycaemic excursion (MAGE) among the three groups. We observed that patients in the three groups had similar MAGE levels at the endpoint; however, Group 2 achieved a significant decrease in the MAGE level from baseline to the endpoint as compared to Groups 1 and 3 (all ",

    "abstract": "A post hoc analysis of the Diabeloop WP7 multicentre, randomized controlled trial was performed to investigate the efficacy of the Diabeloop Generation-1 (DBLG1) closed-loop system in controlling the hypoglycaemia induced by physical activity (PA) in real-life conditions. Glycaemic outcomes were compared between days with and without PA in 56 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using DBLG1 for 12\u2009weeks. After the patient announces a PA, DBLG1 reduces insulin delivery and, if necessary, calculates the amount of preventive carbohydrates (CHO). Daily time spent in the interstitial glucose range\u2009less than\u200970\u2009mg/dL was not significantly different between days with and without PA (2.0%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5% vs. 2.2%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1%), regardless of the intensity or duration of the PA. Preventive CHO intake recommended by the system was significantly higher in days with PA (41.1\u2009\u00b1\u200935.5 vs. 21.8\u2009\u00b1\u200928.5\u00a0g/day; P\u2009<\u2009.0001), and insulin delivery was significantly lower (31.5\u2009\u00b1\u200910.5 vs. 34.0\u2009\u00b1\u200910.5\u00a0U/day; P\u2009<\u2009.0001). The time spent in hyperglycaemia and the glycaemic variation coefficient increased significantly on days with PA. In real-life conditions, the use of DBLG1 avoids PA-induced hypoglycaemia. Insulin adjustments and preventive CHO recommendation may explain this therapeutic benefit.",

    "abstract": "This study primarily focuses on the assessment of dentistry students' improvement of manual skills resulting from their participation in courses. We aimed to prove that systematic manual skills development significantly improves dexterity. We hypothesized that the dexterity training regimen improves manual dexterity demonstrated by the HAM-Man (Hamburg Assessment Test for Medicine-Manual Dexterity) test scores and CGM (cerebellar grey matter) growth. Thirty volunteers were randomly divided into two equal groups (study and control). Firstly, volunteers were examined by the HAM-Man test and baseline MRI scans. Afterwards, a manual skills development course was launched for the \"study group\". Secondly, all the manual skills of the students were evaluated longitudinally, by the HAM-Man test. Simultaneously, the follow-up MRI scans were taken to observe morphologic changes in the cerebellum. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Student Paired t-test were used for statistical analyses. Value p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant. After the training, significant growth of CGM as well as improvement on manual skill assessment tests, were found in the study group. Training courses are suitable for preparing students with low levels of dexterity for performing demanding tasks. The improvement is demonstrable by a wire bending test and by bilateral CGM enlargement as well.",

    "abstract": "Time in range (TIR) is an index of glycemic control obtained from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). The aim was to compare the glycemic variability of treatment with sulfonylureas (SUs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with well-controlled glucose level (TIR\u2009>\u200970%). The study subjects were 123 patients selected T2DM who underwent CGM more than 24\u00a0h on admission without changing treatment. The primary endpoint was the difference in glycemic variability, while the secondary endpoint was the difference in time below range\u2009<\u200954\u00a0mg/dL; TBR\u2009<\u200954, between the SU (n\u2009=\u200963) and non-SU (n\u2009=\u200960) groups. The standard deviation, percentage coefficient of variation (%CV), and maximum glucose level were higher in the SU group than in the non-SU group, and TBR\u2009<\u200954 was longer in the high-dose SU patients. SU treatment was identified as a significant factor that affected %CV (\u03b2: 2.678, p\u2009=\u20090.034). High-dose SU use contributed to prolonged TBR\u2009<\u200954 (\u03b2: 0.487, p\u2009=\u20090.028). Our study identified enlarged glycemic variability in sulfonylurea-treated well-controlled T2DM patients and high-dose SU use was associated with TBR\u2009<\u200954. The results highlight the need for careful adjustment of the SU dose, irrespective of glycated hemoglobin level or TIR value.",

These individuals also show disturbed sleep, which may result from glycemic dysregulation. Whether use of a hybrid closed loop (HCL) insulin delivery system with integrated continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) designed for improving glycemic control, relates to better sleep across time in this population remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to describe long-term changes in glycemic control and objective sleep after initiating hybrid closed loop (HCL) insulin delivery in adults with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycemia unawareness. To accomplish this, six adults (median age = 58\u2009y) participated in an 18-month ongoing trial assessing HCL effectiveness. Glycemic control and sleep were measured using continuous glucose monitoring and wrist accelerometers every 3 months. Paired sample ",

Interventions to reduce risk associated with these exposures are particularly challenging due to the infrequent measurement of blood glucose concentrations, with the potential of causing more harm instead of improving outcomes for these infants. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in adults and children with diabetes to improve glucose control, but has not been approved for use in neonates.

Research using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices has shown that exercise affects glycaemic control in T1DM for over 24\u00a0h. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is, therefore, to investigate the delayed effects of different exercise modalities on glycaemic control in adults with T1DM.",

    "abstract": "The optimal management of glucose levels in critical care remains an area for research due to the problems of balancing the risks of hyperglycemia versus hypoglycemia. This paper reports the first economic evaluation of real time continuous glucose monitoring to guide the clinical management of preterm infants, based on evidence from the REACT trial. Bivariate regression of costs (\u00a3, 2016-17 prices) and cases of adequate glucose control, with multiple imputation of missing data, was conducted. When the economic evaluation was restricted to the first week of life, real time continuous glucose monitoring was associated with increased costs and a statistically significant increase in adequate glucose control. When the assessment was performed over a time horizon extending to 36 weeks' corrected gestational age, real time CGM was dominant in health economic terms, i.e. associated with lower costs and better outcomes. These results largely remained robust to a range of sensitivity analyses and sub-group analyses designed to address uncertainty and heterogeneity surrounding the cost-effectiveness outcomes. This study suggests that the use of real time continuous glucose monitoring in preterm infants is associated with a high probability of cost-effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Whey protein is an insulinotropic fraction of dairy that reduces postprandial glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We have recently shown that \u03b2-lactoglobulin (BLG), the largest protein fraction of whey, elevates insulin concentrations compared with iso-nitrogenous whey protein isolate (WPI) in healthy individuals. We therefore hypothesized that BLG pre-meals would lower glucose levels compared with WPI in patients with T2DM. We investigated 16 participants with T2DM using a randomized double-blinded cross-over design with two pre-meal interventions, (i) 25 g BLG and (ii) 25 g WPI prior to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), followed by four days of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) at home. BLG increased concentrations of insulin with 10%, glucagon with 20%, and glucose with 10% compared with WPI after the OGTT (all ",

    "title": "Pump It Up! A randomized clinical trial to optimize insulin pump self-management behaviors in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) must engage in a variety of complex and burdensome self-management behaviors daily to maintain near normal blood glucose levels and prevent complications. There is a need for interventions to improve use of sophisticated diabetes technologies, such as insulin pumps, during adolescence - a very high-risk developmental period for individuals with T1D. All diabetes devices, including insulin pumps, store large amounts of behavioral data that can be downloaded and analyzed to evaluate adherence to recommended T1D self-management behaviors. The overall objective of the present study, Pump it Up!, was to use objectively downloaded insulin pump data to inform and test two interventions to optimize insulin pump use in adolescents with T1D and their caregivers. Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) was used to achieve the overall goal of this study - to separately test the main effect of the Pump It Up! Personalized T1D Self-Management Behaviors Feedback Report and the main effect of Pump It Up! Problem-Solving Skills intervention to improve T1D self-management behaviors using a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 factorial design. The purpose of this paper is to describe the Pump It Up! study design and rationale, and participant baseline characteristics. Longitudinal data analyses will be conducted, and moderating effects of psychosocial factors will be examined in relation to primary (insulin pump self-management behaviors) and secondary (A1C) outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Alarms in continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGM) represent a very important feature enabling to patients with diabetes who use these systems to keep their blood glucose level in the target range and to avoid excursion to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The possibility to warn the patient that the target range has been crossed means one of the main advantages of CGM over the selfmonitoring of blood glucose with personal glucometers, but also (so far) flash glucose monitoring systems. However, there is surprisingly few studies concerning specifically the relationship between the alarms settings and glucose control. Therefore, there are currently no recommendations nor guidelines for optimal settings of alarms in CGM. Limited number of studies suggest that the setting of the hypoglycemia alarm to a level higher than 4 mmol/L is associated with lower frequency and shorter duration of hypoglycemia, and may be temporarily increased to 6 mmol/L in patients with impaired hypoglycemia awareness.",

    "abstract": "Identifying determinants of low-dose glucagon efficacy is important to optimise its utilization for prevention and treatment of hypoglycaemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The study objective was to investigate whether the preceding glucose decline rate affects glucose response to low-dose glucagon administration. Ten adults with insulin pump-treated type 1 diabetes were included in this randomized, single-blind, two-way crossover study. Using a hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique, plasma glucose levels were reduced with either a rapid or slow decline rate while maintaining fixed insulin levels. When the plasma glucose level reached 3.9\u2009mmoL/L, insulin and glucose infusions were discontinued and 150\u2009\u03bcg subcutaneous glucagon was administered, followed by 120\u2009minutes of plasma glucose monitoring. The positive incremental area under the glucose curve after administration of low-dose glucagon did not differ between the rapid-decline and slow-decline visits (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM: 220\u2009\u00b1\u200949 vs. 174\u2009\u00b1\u200931\u2009mmoL/L x min; P =\u20090.21). Similarly, no differences in total area under the glucose curve, peak plasma glucose, incremental peak plasma glucose, time-to-peak plasma glucose or end plasma glucose were observed. Thus, preceding glucose decline rate did not significantly affect the glucose response to low-dose glucagon.",

    "abstract": "Patients with diabetes are - compared to people without diabetes - at increased risk of worse outcomes from COVID-19 related pneumonia during hospitalization. We aim to investigate whether telemetric continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in quarantined hospitalized patients with diabetes and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or another contagious infection can be successfully implemented and is associated with better glycaemic control than usual blood glucose monitoring (finger prick method) and fewer patient-health care worker contacts. Furthermore, we will assess whether glucose variables are associated with the clinical outcome. The hypothesis is that by using remote CGM to monitor glucose levels of COVID-19 infected patients and patients with other contagious infections with diabetes, we can still provide satisfactory (and maybe even better) in-hospital diabetes management despite patients being quarantined. Furthermore, the number of patient-personnel contacts can be lowered compared to standard monitoring with finger-prick glucose. This could potentially reduce the risk of transmitting contagious diseases from the patient to other people and reduces the use of PPE's. Improved glucose control may reduce the increased risk of poor clinical outcomes associated with combined diabetes and infection.",

    "abstract": "A 6-week, randomized, open-label, active-controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the influence of a low-dose curcumagalactomannosides (CGM) (400\u2009mg once daily) in OA subjects. The treatment was compared with a standard combination of 500\u2009mg glucosamine hydrochloride (GLN) and 415\u2009mg chondroitin sulphate (CHN), supplied as a single oral dose twice a day. Out of 84 subjects randomized, 72 subjects who have completed the study were evaluated for the safety and efficacy of the treatments at baseline and subsequent visits (day 28 and 42), by measuring walking performance, VAS, KPS, and WOMAC scores. CGM exhibited 47.02, 21.43, and 206% improvement in VAS, KPS, and walking performance, respectively, compared to the baseline. Similarly, there was 31.17, 32.93, 36.44, and 35% improvement in the pain, stiffness, physical function, and total WOMAC scores. CGM also caused a substantial reduction in the serum inflammatory marker levels. The results indicate that a short-term supplementation of a low dosage CGM exerted superior beneficial effects than a high-dosage CHN-GLN combination in alleviating the pain and symptoms of OA subjects. Further clinical trials of extended duration in a larger population is required to substantiate the efficacy of CGM in the long-term management of OA.",

    "abstract": "To determine if pump therapy with continuous glucose monitoring offering low glucose suspend (LGS) decreases fear of hypoglycemia among children with type 1 diabetes and their parents. The CGM TIME trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial that enrolled 144 children with type 1 diabetes for at least 1\u2009year (mean duration 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1\u2009years) starting pump therapy (MiniMed\u2122 Veo\u2122, Medtronic Canada). CGM (MiniMed\u2122 Enlite\u2122 sensor) offering LGS was introduced simultaneously or delayed for 6\u2009months. Hypoglycemia Fear Scale (HFS) was completed by children \u226510\u2009years old and all parents, at study entry and 12 months later. Simultaneous and Delayed Group participants were combined for all analyses. Subscale scores were compared with paired t-tests, and individual items with paired Wilcoxon tests. Linear regression examined association with CGM adherence. 121/140 parents and 91/99 children \u226510\u2009years had complete data. Mean Behavior subscale score decreased from 21.1 (SD 5.9) to 17.2 (SD 6.1) (p\u2009<\u2009.001) for children, and 20.7 (SD 7.5) to 17.4 (7.4) (p\u2009<\u2009.001) for parents. Mean Worry subscale score decreased from 17.9 (SD 11.9) to 11.9 (SD 11.4) (p\u2009<\u2009.001) for children, and 23.1 (SD 13.2) to 17.6 (SD 10.4) (p\u2009<\u2009.001) for parents. Median scores for 10/25 child items and 12/25 parent items were significantly lower at 12 months (p\u2009<\u2009.001). Linear regression found no association between HFS scores and CGM adherence. Insulin pump therapy with CGM offering LGS significantly reduced fear of hypoglycemia not related to CGM adherence in children with type 1 diabetes and their parents.",

Given the considerable interest in this topic within the diabetes community, we have conducted a systematic review of DIYAPS efficacy, safety, and user experience. Following recognised procedures and reporting standards, we identified 10 eligible publications of 730 participants within the peer-reviewed literature. Overall, studies reported improvements in time in range, HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin), reduced hypoglycaemia, and improved quality of life with DIYAPS use. While results were positive, the identified studies were small, and the majority were observational and at high risk of bias. Further research including well-designed randomised trials comparing DIYAPS with appropriate comparators is recommended.",

During the MOBILE study's baseline phase, we evaluated 173 participants' continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD age 57\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u2009years; 50% female; HbA1c 9.1% [range 7.1%-11.6%]; 40% using sulphonylureas; 19% using NPH; reported self-monitored blood glucose [SMBG] frequency median 1.0 checks/day) who were using basal, but not prandial insulin. Blinded CGM data were recorded for 10\u2009days prior to randomization. The mean glucose value was 208\u2009\u00b1\u200947\u2009mg/dL and it was lowest in the early morning. Mean time in the 70-180\u2009mg/dL range was 9.6 \u00b1\u20096.1 hours/day (40%\u2009\u00b1\u200925%). Hyperglycaemia was extensive with medians of 14.7 (61%) and 5.0 (20.9%) hours/day with glucose greater than 180 and\u2009250\u2009mg/dL, respectively. Hypoglycaemia was infrequent (median [IQR] 0 [0, 4.3] minutes/day [0.0% {0.0%, 0.3%}] with glucose less than 70\u2009mg/dL). Blinded CGM highlights the limitations of infrequent SMBG in basal insulin users with T2D and allows characterization of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia in basal insulin users with suboptimal control. The MOBILE study randomized phase will define the benefits of using real-time CGM compared with SMBG in this population.",

    "title": "Education programmes for persons with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Education is essential in insulin pump therapy, but literature in the field is limited. We systematically reviewed insulin pump education programmes and their effects in two situations as follows: (1) basic education at the start of insulin pump therapy, providing the study design enabled us to separate the effects of insulin pump therapy itself from the effects of education and (2) re-education of experienced pump users. Population: individuals \u226516 years with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps with or without continuous glucose monitoring. Systematic searches were run in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and ERIC. Original studies reporting an effect of insulin pump education programmes were included if published in English between January 1999 and May 2019. Of 988 potentially relevant studies, 48 were assessed in full text. Nine studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including one randomised controlled trial. Educational approaches and settings were sparsely described in all studies, and the content was usually reported as teaching points. Two studies considered basic education, reporting evaluations of knowledge and application skills, and programme satisfaction. The remaining seven studies referred to re-education. Two studies measured severe hypoglycaemic events before and after a re-education intervention, both reporting a significant event reduction. HbA1c decreased significantly in three of four studies. Two studies reported increased knowledge and improved application skills. In conclusion, this review indicates benefits from basic education and from re-education. The strength of the conclusions is limited by the low number of studies and study designs. High-quality studies are needed comparing different approaches for insulin pump education.",

    "title": "Diet-induced differences in estimated plasma glucose concentrations in healthy, non-diabetic adults are detected by continuous glucose monitoring-a randomized crossover trial.",
    "abstract": "Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) have been developed for diabetic patients for estimating and controlling plasma glucose changes throughout the day. However, elevated postprandial glucose concentrations may also be detrimental for non-diabetic subjects by increasing the risk of developing vascular complications and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, CGMs may also be valuable in clinical research and we hypothesized that diet-induced differences in estimated plasma glucose concentrations in healthy, non-diabetic adults could be detected by the Abbott FreeStyle Libre Pro CGM. In this single-blind randomized cross-over trial, 23 healthy but overweight or obese men and women therefore consumed two diets differing in glycemic load in randomized order for three consecutive days. Based on the CGM measurements, two-hour total areas under the curve (tAUCs) after breakfast, lunch and dinner were calculated. Additionally, postprandial glucose was measured with the CGM and in plasma during a rice meal challenge. The average tAUC was significantly lower on the low GL diet compared to the high GL diet (P\u202f<\u202f.0001). The same conclusions were drawn when tAUCs for breakfast (P\u202f<\u202f.0001), lunch (P\u202f<\u202f.0001) and dinner (P\u202f<\u202f.0001) were analyzed separately. During the rice meal challenge, significantly higher glucose responses were observed after the low GL period, as monitored by both the CGM device (P\u202f<\u202f.0001) and the plasma glucose analysis (P\u202f<\u202f.0001). The difference between the means of both methods was 0.11 mmol/L (1.78%) with a higher glucose value in plasma. The absolute mean difference was 0.66 mmol/L (10.5%). We conclude that the CGM detected diet-induced differences in estimated plasma glucose concentrations, which supports its use not only in clinical practice, but also for research purposes during dietary interventions in non-diabetic participants.",

It is designed for problems which include a learning agent interacting with its environment to achieve a goal. For example, blood glucose (BG) control in diabetes mellitus (DM), where the learning agent and its environment are the controller and the body of the patient respectively. RL algorithms could be used to design a fully closed-loop controller, providing a truly personalized insulin dosage regimen based exclusively on the patient's own data.",

    "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) annually affects 35,000 pregnancies in the United Kingdom, causing suboptimal health outcomes to the mother and child. Obesity and excessive gestational weight gain are risk factors for GDM. The Institute of Medicine recommends weight targets for women that are overweight and obese, however, there are no clear guidelines for women with GDM. Observational data suggest that modest weight loss (0.6-2 kg) after 28 weeks may reduce risk of caesarean section, large-for-gestational-age (LGA), and maternal postnatal glycaemia. This protocol for a multicentre randomised double-blind controlled trial aims to identify if a fully controlled reduced energy diet in GDM pregnancy improves infant birthweight and reduces maternal weight gain (primary outcomes). A total of 500 women with GDM (National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2015 criteria) and body mass index (BMI) \u226525 kg/m",

Previous hunger training interventions used fingerprick blood glucose, however continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers a painless and convenient form of glucose monitoring. The aim of this randomised feasibility trial was to compare hunger training using CGM with fingerprick glucose monitoring in terms of adherence to the protocol, acceptability, weight, body composition, HbA1c, psychosocial variables, and the relationship between adherence measures and weight loss.",

Limited data are available on how carbohydrate distribution throughout the day affects blood glucose in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We aimed to assess how a high-carbohydrate morning-intake (HCM) versus a low-carbohydrate-morning-intake (LCM), affect glycemic variability and glucose control. In this randomized crossover study continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed in 12 women with diet treated GDM (75 g, 2-h OGTT \u2265 8.5 mmol/L), who went through 2 \u00d7 3 days of HCM and LCM.

However, two-thirds of overweight/obese adults are not sufficiently active; this, in combination with the unfavorable effect of excess body weight, puts them at a greater risk for cancer. One reason that these individuals do not engage in enough PA may be their lack of motivation to change their current behavior due to the perception of putting in effort for possible future gain without obvious short-term benefits. There is a need for innovative ways to help individuals recognize the immediate health benefits of PA and thus increase their motivation.",

    "abstract": "This article offers a systematic review of the literature on psychosocial aspects of technology use in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their families, searching for relevant articles published the past 5\u00a0years. Topics included continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, continuous glucose monitoring, predictive low-glucose suspend, and artificial pancreas systems. The review indicates there are positive and negative psychosocial aspects to diabetes technology use among youth and their families. Although consistent findings were revealed, contradictions exist. Discussed are recommendations for future research and implications for how health care providers can collaborate with families to discuss and manage diabetes technology.",

Economic costs are also high, estimated at approximately \u00a313 million annually in England, UK. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to reduce hypoglycaemia and associated fear, improve overall glycaemia and quality of life, and is cost-effective. Despite effective pathways in place with high levels of resource utilization, it has been reported there are low levels of follow-up, therapy change and specialist intervention after severe hypoglycaemia. This study is designed to assess the impact of providing real-time CGM to people with type 1 diabetes, who have had a recent episode of severe hypoglycaemia (within 72\u2009h), compared to standard care.",

Fifteen adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes underwent 22\u2009hours of closed-loop insulin delivery with either faster or standard insulin aspart in a double-blind randomized crossover design. Basal-bolus regimen was replaced by model predictive control algorithm-directed insulin delivery based on sensor glucose levels. The primary outcome was time with plasma glucose in target range (5.6-10.0\u2009mmol/L) and did not differ between treatments (mean difference [95% CI] 3.3% [-8.2; 1.7], P = 0.17). Mean glucose and glucose variability were comparable, as was time spent below and above target range. Hypoglycaemia (<3.5\u2009mmol/L) occurred once with faster insulin aspart and twice with standard insulin aspart. Mean total insulin dose was higher with faster insulin aspart (mean difference [95% CI] 3.7 U [0.7; 6.8], P = 0.021). No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia or other serious adverse events occurred. In conclusion, short-term fully closed-loop in type 2 diabetes may require higher dose of faster insulin aspart compared with standard insulin aspart to achieve comparable glucose control.",

Extremely preterm infants are prone to hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia; both of which have been associated with adverse outcomes.

    "abstract": "The optimal timing between meal ingestion and simple physical activity for improving blood glucose control is unknown. This study compared the effects of physical activity on postprandial interstitial glucose responses when the activity was conducted either immediately before, immediately after, or 30\u00a0min after breakfast. Forty-eight adults were randomized to three separate physical activity interventions: standing still (for 30\u00a0min), walking (for 30\u00a0min), and bodyweight exercises (3 sets of 10 squats, 10 push-ups, 10 lunges, 10 sit-ups). In each intervention, 16 participants completed four trials (A to D) during which a 500\u00a0kcal mixed nutrient liquid breakfast meal was consumed. Interstitial glucose responses were recorded using continuous glucose monitoring for 2\u00a0h after the meal. The activity was completed either after the glucose monitoring period (trial A; control) or immediately before (trial B), immediately after (trial C), or 30\u00a0min after (trial D) the breakfast. Mean, coefficient of variance (CV), and area under the curve (AUC) for glucose were calculated and compared between the four trials. Walking and bodyweight exercises immediately after the meal improved mean, CV, and AUC glucose (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 vs. control), while standing immediately after the meal only improved AUC glucose (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 vs. control) and nearly improved mean glucose (P\u2009=\u20090.06). Mean, CV, and AUC glucose were not affected by standing, walking, or bodyweight exercise conducted immediately before, or 30\u00a0min after the meal (all P\u2009>\u20090.05 vs. control). Energy intake (diet records) and energy expenditure (Actigraph) were consistent throughout the studies and did not influence the findings. Low- to moderate-intensity activity should be implemented soon after eating to improve glucose control following breakfast. The type of activity appears less important than the timing. These findings will help optimize exercise-meal timing in general health guidelines. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03730727.",

Pubmed and Google Scholar were searched for randomized crossover trials, published between January 2013 and July 2018, in nonpregnant outpatients with DM1, which compared event rates during PLGS overnight periods and non-PLGS overnight periods. The primary outcome was the proportion of overnight periods with one or more hypoglycemic measurement. When available, individual patient data were used to assess the effect of clustering measurements within patients. Four studies (272 patients, 10,735 patient-nights: 5422 PLGS and 5313 non-PLGS) were included in the meta-analysis. Two studies reported patient-level data that permitted assessment of the effect of clustering measurements within patients. The effect on the risk difference was minimal. The proportion of overnight periods with one or more episodes of hypoglycemia was 19.6% for the PLGS periods and 27.8% for the non-PLGS periods. Based on the pooled estimate, PLGS overnight periods were associated with an 8.8% lower risk of hypoglycemia (risk difference -0.088; 95% CI -0.119 to -0.056, ",

    "abstract": "Some patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are severely noncompliant; they rarely perform self-blood glucose measures and miss insulin injections. Their HbA1c is far above the target rate. Current guidelines do not recommend starting treatment with an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) for these persons. The aim of this study was to determine whether a CSII associated with a flash glucose monitoring (FGM) device could reduce HbA1c without increasing the risk of acute events, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hypoglycemia (SH), in these patients. We conducted a 6-month nonrandomized, pilot prospective study. Patients with T1D on multiple daily injections who performed less than two self-blood glucose tests/day and had an HbA1c >9% were equipped with CSII and an FGM device. The primary composite endpoint was defined by a change in HbA1c \u22651% without any episode of DKA or SH during 6 months. Change in mean HbA1c, weight, treatment satisfaction, frequency of minor hypoglycemia, and ketoacidosis were secondary endpoints. Nineteen adults were included. Median (Q",

    "abstract": "Inpatient diabetes management of those on hemodialysis poses a major challenge. In a post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled clinical trial, we compared the efficacy of fully automated closed-loop insulin delivery vs. usual care in patients undergoing hemodialysis while in hospital. Compared to control patients receiving conventional subcutaneous insulin therapy, those patients receiving closed-loop insulin delivery significantly increased the proportion of time when a continuous glucose monitor was in the target range of 5.6-10.0 mmol/l by 37.6 percent without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, closed-loop insulin delivery offers a novel way to achieve effective and safe glucose control in this vulnerable patient population.",

Many children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) treated with multiple daily injections as well as with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) switched from self-monitoring of blood glucose to isCGM to monitor their treatment. In 2017 the Enlite\u00ae real-time CGM (rtCGM) system was reimbursed enabling its use with the Minimed\u00ae 640G insulin pump with integrated SmartGuard technology. In this study we compared the metabolic control during CSII with isCGM with that during rtCGM. Patient's satisfaction and side effects of the rtCGM system were also evaluated.",

Although different studies have evaluated the diagnostic value of CGM in CAD diagnosis, no pooled analysis of its diagnostic accuracy has been performed so far. This study aimed to assess the value of CGM in diagnosing CAD in patients with suspected stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD).This was a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted on available literature until May 2018. Studies considered coronary angiography as the reference standard for CAD diagnosis and reported CGM diagnostic value parameters were included. No language and time restrictions for enrolling the studies were considered. Statistical analysis was performed using Meta-DiSc software.The findings of the 10 studies published in 9 articles were enrolled in the meta-analysis. Overall pooled sensitivity was 71.7% (69.1 to 74.1; Cochrane Q = 39.5; P < 0.00001; I",

In patients on multiple daily insulin (MDI) injections, such control in overnight glucose levels has not been possible due to the inability to alter the absorption rate of long-acting insulin after injection. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that increases/decreases of fasting glucose levels could be achieved by cooling/warming the skin around the injection site, which would result in lower/higher Glargine absorption rates from its subcutaneous depot.",

    "title": "Clinical efficacy of Professional Continuous Glucose Monitoring in improving glycemic control among children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: An Open-label Randomized Control Trial.",
    "abstract": "Frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is the only accurate method available for insulin dose titration in patients with T1DM. Professional continuous glucose monitoring (p-CGM) is blinded recording of glucose trends over 5-7 days and helps physicians to guide insulin titration to patient. This study was planned to assess efficacy of insulin dose adjustments, based on\u00a0p-CGM plus SMBG in improving glycemic control compared to SMBG alone. We did an open-label, parallel design, randomized control trial among children (2-10 years) having T1DM for at least 6 months. Subjects in the intervention group were placed on p-CGM (iPRO 2\u2122 Professional CGM, Medtronic, USA) for 3-5 days along with regular SMBG. Data from p-CGM was analyzed by physician and used to guide insulin titration along with SMBG over following 3 months. Control group had only SMBG records for titrating insulin doses. Primary outcome was change in HbA1c 3 months after intervention. A total of 68 eligible children were randomized, 34 each to either arms. Thirty children in intervention group and 33 in control group completed the study and were analyzed. It was found that there was more decreased unit change in HbA1c, percentage of low sugar records and total insulin requirement per day, after 3 months follow-up, in intervention group. However, difference was not significant except for total insulin Units/kg/day (p\u2009=\u20090.014). In sub-group analysis of children with baseline HbA1c >7.5%, there was a significant mean fall of HbA1c by 1.27% (p\u2009=\u20090.045). There were no major adverse events associated with p-CGM. We conclude that addition of p-CGM along with SMBG may help in adjusting insulin dose more effectively especially in children with higher baseline HbA1c.",

    "abstract": "The effects of acarbose and sitagliptin on blood glucose fluctuation and islet \u03b2-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were studied. One hundred and three patients with poorly controlled T2DM with insulin aspart 30 were selected and randomly divided into three groups: group A [continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment group], group B (CSII combined with acarbose treatment), group C (CSII combined with sitagliptin treatment). The treatment lasted for two weeks and the clinical indicators in the three groups were measured. The insulin dosage was adjusted according to the blood glucose statuses of the three groups of patients. In the final three days, 72 h of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were carried out, and the OGTT test was performed again. The results showed that the MODD (absolute means of daily difference), intra-day blood glucose fluctuation indices [(24 h MBG (mean blood glucose), LAGE (largest amplitude of glycemic excursions) and MAGE (average blood glucose fluctuation)] and postprandial blood glucose fluctuation indices [PGS (postprandial glucose spike), \u25b3t, PPGE (postprandial glucose excursion) and T (time) total] in group C and group B were significantly lower than those in group A. Compared with group B, the difference in blood glucose fluctuation indices in group C was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The HOMA-islet (homeostasis model assessment of islet) (CP-DM) index and FC-P (Fasting c-peptide) levels in group C and group B were significantly higher than those in group A (P less than 0.01). The HOMA-IR (CP) index of groups B and C was significantly lower than that of group A (P less than 0.01), and there was no statistically significant difference between groups B and C (P less than 0.05). Sitagliptin combined with intensive insulin pump therapy can reduce blood glucose fluctuation throughout the day, reduce insulin dosage, improve islet B cell function and reduce hypoglycemia better than intensive insulin pump therapy alone.",

    "title": "Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs modern multiple injection regimens in type 1 diabetes: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.",
    "abstract": "Meta-analyses of clinical trials comparing CSII with traditional insulin injections usually show a small, but significant advantage of CSII with respect to HbA1c and risk of severe hypoglycemia. On the other hand, CSII is associated with a small, but relevant risk of ketoacidosis, mainly due to malfunction of insulin pump and/or catheter occlusion. During last time, the technology of insulin pumps and infusion sets has improved as the profound evolution in type and schemes with traditional insulin injections. Aim of the present study is to update previous meta-analyses comparing CSII with traditional insulin injections in subjects with type 1 diabetes. Specific subgroup analyses were designed for assessing the effects of CSII in comparison with basal-bolus MDI, with short-acting analogues as bolus and long-acting analogues as basal insulin. In addition, an exploratory analysis was performed to verify the effect of CSII in insulin-na\u00efve patients with type 1 diabetes. The present analysis includes all randomized clinical trials comparing CSII with traditional injections in type 1 diabetes, with a duration of at least 12 weeks. Animal studies were excluded, whereas no language or date restriction was imposed. If duplicate publications of a single trial were present, the paper containing more adequate information was considered as principal publication. In trials comparing CSII with basal-bolus MDI, performed before the introduction of rapid-acting analogues, regular human insulin was used for CSII, and as prandial insulin in control groups. CSII was associated with a significant reduction of A1c, in comparison with MDI, irrespective of the use of either human insulin or rapid-acting analogues. However, in trials with rapid-acting analogue the advantage of CSII was significantly smaller than in trials with regular human insulin (HbA1c difference: -\u20090.29[-\u20090.46; -\u20090.13] vs -\u20091.93[-\u20091.84; -\u20090.42]%; p\u2009=\u20090.02). Different rapid-acting analogues provided similar results (HbA1c reduction vs MDI: -\u20090.25 [-\u20090.48; -\u20090.02]%, p\u2009=\u20090.03, and -\u20090.29 [-\u20090.49; -\u20090.09]%, p\u2009=\u20090.005, for lispro and aspart, respectively). In addition, in trials comparing CSII with basal-bolus MDI, CSII reduced HbA1c to a similar extent irrespective of the use of either NPH or long-acting analogues as basal insulin in the control groups (HbA1c reduction vs MDI: -\u20090.31 [-\u20090.55; -\u20090.06]%, p\u2009=\u20090.01, and -\u20090.20 [-\u20090.38; -\u20090.03]%, p\u2009=\u20090.02, for NPH and long-acting analogues, respectively. With respect to severe hypoglycemia, CSII did not produce a significant reduction of risk in comparison with traditional insulin injections. Conversely, CSII was associated with a significant increase in the incidence of reported diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Notably, the increased risk of DKA was significant in trials comparing CSII with conventional insulin therapy, whereas only a nonsignificant trend toward an increased risk was observed in comparisons with basal-bolus MDI. Only two trials comparing CSII with basal-bolus MDI, both using rapid-acting analogues, were performed on insulin-na\u00efve type 1 diabetic patients. When those two trials were analyzed separately, CSII did not produce any relevant effect on HbA1c (difference from control: -\u20090.10[-\u20090.38; +\u20090.17]%; p\u2009=\u20090.46). No meta-analysis could be performed on either severe hypoglycemia or DKA, which were not reported by one of the two trials. CSII seems to produce a small improvement in HbA1c in patients with type 1 diabetes inadequately controlled with MDI. This apparent effect, which could be partly due to publication bias, is smaller when MDI is properly performed using basal-bolus schemes with short-acting insulin analogues. Other outcomes different from HbA1c (such as quality of life) could be relevant for the choice of CSII instead of MDI. In addition, further studies are needed to better define the profile of patients who could benefit most from CSII.",

    "title": "Tissue Response to Subcutaneous Infusion Catheter.",
    "abstract": "Insulin infusion pump, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and insulin infusion set (IIS) have been developed to be increasingly feasible for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Several recently approved CGMs are transitioning from 7-day to 10-day wear time without the need for fingerprick recalibration. Nevertheless, studies and improvements on IIS, a critical part of insulin pump therapy, have been limited. In particular, the recommended wear time of IIS is still 2-3\u2009days, which can hardly match the current duration of CGM for potential closed-loop system development. It is generally believed that both the inserted catheter and the subsequent infused insulin drug could induce particular subcutaneous tissue response and skin-related complications at the infusion site. In certain cases, poor glycaemic control, increased risk of hypoglycemia, and serious cosmetic impact on people with diabetes were observed. Skin complication has also been attributed as an important factor resulting users to discontinue insulin pump therapy. This article provides the rare systematic review of IIS induced subcutaneous tissue responses and skin complications, including the impacts from the inserted catheters, the subcutaneous infused insulin, and the adhesive or tape used to immobilize the catheter. The FDA's recommendation for the frequency of IIS change was further discussed. Future studies on this topic are required to further understand the IIS-related problems, and future strategies could be developed accordingly to significantly reduce the incidence of these problems, extend the wear time, and increase the acceptance of insulin pump based therapy.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on blood glucose levels, body weight, blood pressure, and hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov. RCTs using CGM in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were then selected. Statistical analysis included calculation of the standardized mean difference (SMD) or risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model. After literature search, seven RCTs (669 patients) satisfied the eligibility criteria established herein and were included into the meta-analysis. Compared with the self-monitoring blood glucose group, the CGM group exhibited significantly lower HbA1c levels (SMD, -0.35; 95% CI, -0.59--0.10; ",

    "title": "Use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Trends to Facilitate Exercise in Children with Type 1 Diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Diabetes care during exercise frequently requires interruptions to activity and adds extra challenges particularly for young individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). This study investigated the use of a carbohydrate (CHO) intake algorithm based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) trends during physical activity. Children with T1D diagnosed for >1 year, ages 8-12 years, with a glycated hemoglobin of <10% were recruited into a randomized crossover study. They attended two similar mornings of fun-based physical activity and adhered to either a CHO intake algorithm based on CGM trends (intervention) or to standard exercise guidelines (consumption of 0.5\u2009g CHO/kg/h when glucose <8\u2009mmol/L) (control). Outcome measures included events such as exercise interruptions, CHO intake, and hypoglycemia events and percentage time spent in different sensor glucose ranges. Fourteen children completed the study. No episodes of significant hypoglycemia (sensor glucose level <3.0\u2009mmol/L) occurred in either arm. Mean CHO intake was the same in both arms, 0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009g/kg/h. However, the intervention algorithm resulted in fewer CHO intake events per day: rate [95% confidence interval] 2.4 [1.6-2.3] versus 0.9 [0.4-1.5], P\u2009<\u20090.001, and exercise interruptions: 7.2 [5.9-8.8] versus 1.4 [0.8-2.1], P\u2009<\u20090.001, compared with control. There was no evidence of a difference in percentage time in range (3.9-10\u2009mmol/L) and percentage time spent high between study arms. Both control and intervention protocols prevented significant hypoglycemia. Using a CHO intake algorithm based on CGM trends resulted in fewer CHO intake events and fewer interruptions to exercise. Use of this algorithm may reduce the burden of diabetes management with potential to facilitate activity in young people with T1D.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid closed loop (HCL) insulin delivery with the Medtronic Minimed 670G system is effective and safe in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). This study compared glucose control, closed loop (CL) exits, and alarm frequency with the standard HCL (s-HCL) versus enhanced HCL (e-HCL) Medtronic system. Pump-experienced T1D adults (n\u2009=\u200911; 9 female; mean [SD] age: 51 years [15 years]; HbA1c 7.5% [1.0%] or 58\u2009mmol/mol [7.7\u2009mmol/mol]) were assigned, in random order, s-HCL or e-HCL for 1 week each in a supervised live-in setting. e-HCL incorporated enhanced bolus reminders and iterative changes, broadening glucose and insulin delivery parameters permitting persistence in CL. For both s-HCL and e-HCL, insulin delivery was by a Medtronic pump with identical interventions (missed bolus, exercise, high-glycemic index, and high-fat meals), insulin action times, and insulin-carbohydrate ratios implemented. The primary outcome was continuous glucose monitoring time in target range. Analysis was by paired t-test for normally distributed data and Wilcoxon-signed rank test otherwise. e-HCL resulted in significantly fewer CL alerts and exits. Time in target and mean glucose favored e-HCL but did not reach statistical significance. No episodes of severe hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis occurred. Relative to s-HCL, e-HCL use significantly decreases CL exits and alerts, and tended to improve glycemia without compromising safety, despite multiple food and exercise challenges during the study. Longer term studies at home are merited.",

    "abstract": "Liraglutide is associated with blood pressure reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, it is not known whether this blood pressure reduction can be predicted prior to treatment initiation, and to what extent it correlates with weight loss and with improved glycemic control during follow-up. We analyzed data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in which 124 insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to liraglutide or placebo. We evaluated various baseline variables as potential predictors of systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction, and evaluated whether changes in SBP correlated with weight loss and with improved glycemic control. A greater reduction in SBP among liraglutide-treated patients was predicted by higher baseline values of SBP (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012), and by lower baseline values of mean glucose measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM; P\u00a0=\u00a00.044), and serum fasting C-peptide (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015). The regression coefficients differed significantly between the liraglutide group and the placebo group only for diastolic blood pressure (P\u00a0=\u00a00.037) and mean CGM (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021). During the trial period, SBP reduction correlated directly with change in body weight and BMI, but not with change in HbA1c. We conclude that patients with lower mean CGM values at baseline responded to liraglutide with a larger reduction in SBP, and that improved HbA1c during follow-up was not associated with reductions of SBP. Our data suggest that some patients with type 2 diabetes may benefit from liraglutide in terms of weight and SBP reduction.",

However, a module describing the pharmacokinetics of the new long-acting insulin analogues is not available. The aim of this contribution is to reproduce multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) therapy, with insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100) as basal insulin, using the TID simulator. This was achieved by developing a model of Gla-100 and by incorporating it into the simulator. The methodology described here can be extended to other insulins, allowing an extensive in silico testing of different long-acting insulin analogues under various settings before starting human trials.",

    "abstract": "Considering the recent interest in free (unconjugated) curcuminoids delivery, the present study investigated the efficacy of a novel food-grade free-curcuminoids delivery system (curcumin-galactomannoside complex; CGM) in improving the hepatic function markers (inflammation and oxidative stress) in chronic alcoholics. The double-blinded, placebo-controlled study randomized 48 subjects with elevated serum transaminases and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels, who were allocated to two groups (n=24) and to receive either placebo or CGM at (250\u2009mg \u00d7 2)/day for 8 weeks. While liver function markers (transaminases and GGT) in the placebo group showed an increase (~ 9.5%), CGM group indicated a significant decrease in transaminases (31%) and GGT (29%) from the baseline levels. The beneficial effect of CGM was also clear from the significant increase (p <0.001) in endogenous antioxidants (GSH, SOD, and GPx) and decrease in inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) levels (p <0.001) as compared to both the baseline and placebo group. To summarize, the nutritional intervention of CGM-curcumin was found to offer a significant hepatoprotective effect to attenuate the alcohol induced alterations to hepatic function markers.

In this study, we investigated the effects of IDeg on glycemic control in dogs. Its time-action profiles were monitored in healthy dogs using an artificial pancreas apparatus under euglycemic conditions. At 9.0-13.5 hr post-IDeg injection, an indistinct peak of glucose level was detected. Moreover, the action of IDeg was persistent for >20 hr. Both IDeg and neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH) lowered blood glucose concentrations in diabetic dogs, but IDeg caused postprandial hyperglycemia and a somewhat lower preprandial glucose level than that caused by NPH. IDeg might be ineffective in concurrently preventing postprandial hyperglycemia and preprandial hypoglycemia in a single-agent administration.",

    "abstract": "This randomized control trial investigated glucose control with closed-loop (CL) versus threshold-low-glucose-suspend (TLGS) insulin pump delivery in pre-pubertal children with type 1 diabetes in supervised hotel conditions. The patients [n\u2009=\u200924, age range: 7-12, HbA1c: 7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5% (58\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009mmol/mol)] and their parents were admitted twice at a 3-week interval. CL control to range or TLGS set at 3.9\u2009mmoL/L were assessed for 48\u2009hour in randomized order. Admissions included three meals and one snack, and physical exercise. Meal boluses followed individual insulin/carb ratios. While overnight (22:00-08:00) per cent continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) time below 3.9 mmol/L (primary outcome) was similar, time in ranges 3.9 to 10.0 and 3.9 to 7.8 mmoL/L and mean CGM were all significantly improved with CL (P\u2009<\u20090.001). These results were confirmed over the whole 48\u2009hour. Disconnections between devices and limited accuracy of glucose sensors in the hypoglycaemic range appeared as limiting factors for optimal control. CL mode was well accepted while fear of hypoglycaemia was unchanged. CL did not minimize nocturnal hypoglycaemia exposure but improved time in target range compared to TLGS. Although safe and well-accepted, CL systems would benefit from more integrated devices.",

    "title": "The Effect of Reduced Self-Monitored Blood Glucose Testing After Adoption of Continuous Glucose Monitoring on Hemoglobin A1c and Time in Range.",
    "abstract": "The effectiveness of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) in adults with diabetes treated with insulin injections was evaluated in the 24-week DIAMOND clinical trial comparing rtCGM users to a control group using self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) testing ( Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02282397). All participants were instructed to use SMBG results for diabetes management decisions; however, SMBG testing frequency varied within the rtCGM group. This brief report evaluated how SMBG frequency changes in the rtCGM group were correlated with glycemic outcomes in the same trial. Baseline and end-of-study hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, percentages of CGM values in the 70-180\u2009mg/dL target range (time in range [TIR]), mean of daily differences (MODD), and glycemic coefficients of variation (CVs) were compared. The rtCGM group analyzed included 175 participants-99 with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 76 with type 2 diabetes (T2D). When comparing participants whose SMBG testing frequency decreased by >1/day versus \u22641/day, mean change in HbA1c was similar (-0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 percentage points in both groups, P\u2009=\u20090.59), as was change in TIR (+3.9\u2009\u00b1\u200914.3 vs. +5.7\u2009\u00b1\u200913.7 percentage points, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.39). Likewise, when comparing participants in the highest and lowest quartiles of SMBG frequency reduction (\u22652.2 vs. \u22640.4 fewer tests/day, respectively), changes in HbA1c (-0.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 vs. -0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 percentage points, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.52) and TIR (+4.8\u2009\u00b1\u200913.2 vs. +5.6\u2009\u00b1\u200912.7 percentage points, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.98) were similar. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) change in MODD was -8.3\u2009mg/dL (14.8) and -5.5\u2009mg/dL (14.7) for participants who reduced their SMBG frequency by >1 test/day and \u22641 test/day, respectively; the mean (SD) change in CV was -3.6% (5.0) and -1.6% (5.1) for participants who reduced their SMBG frequency by >1 test/day and \u22641 test/day, respectively. These findings suggest that individuals who decrease the frequency of SMBG testing can effectively base some of their diabetes-related treatment decisions on glucose concentrations, trend information, and alarms provided by their rtCGM systems.",

    "abstract": "Despite considerable advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), its prediction remains unresolved and depends mainly on clinical data. The aim of this study is to build a predictive model based on clinical variables and cytokine gene polymorphism for predicting acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) from the analysis of a large cohort of HLA-identical sibling donor allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) patients. A total of 25 SNPs in 12 cytokine genes were evaluated in 509 patients. Data were analyzed using a linear regression model and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The statistical model was constructed by randomly selecting 85% of cases (training set), and the predictive ability was confirmed based on the remaining 15% of cases (test set). Models including clinical and genetic variables (CG-M) predicted severe aGVHD significantly better than models including only clinical variables (C-M) or only genetic variables (G-M). For grades 3-4 aGVHD, the correct classification rates (CCR1) were: 100% for CG-M, 88% for G-M, and 50% for C-M. On the other hand, CG-M and G-M predicted extensive cGVHD better than C-M (CCR1: 80% vs. 66.7%, respectively). A risk score was calculated based on LASSO multivariate analyses. It was able to correctly stratify patients who developed grades 3-4 aGVHD (",

However, demanding patient intervention is still required, particularly at meal times. To reduce treatment burden, the automatic regulation of glucose (ARG) algorithm mitigates postprandial glucose excursions without feedforward insulin boluses.

    "title": "Adaptability of Closed Loop During Labor, Delivery, and Postpartum: A Secondary Analysis of Data from Two Randomized Crossover Trials in Type 1 Diabetes Pregnancy.",
    "abstract": "Tight glucose control during labor and delivery is recommended for pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. This can be challenging to achieve using the current treatment modalities. The automated nature of closed loop and its ability to adapt to real-time glucose levels make it well suited for use during labor, delivery, and the immediate postpartum period. We report observational data of participants from two randomized crossover trials who chose to continue using closed loop during labor, delivery, and postpartum. Labor was defined as the 24\u2009h before delivery and postpartum as the 48\u2009h after delivery. The glucose target range during pregnancy was 3.5-7.8\u2009mmol/L (63-140\u2009mg/dL) and 3.9-10\u2009mmol/L (70-180\u2009mg/dL) after delivery. Twenty-seven (84.4%) of the potential 32 trial participants used closed loop through labor, delivery, and postpartum. Use of closed loop was associated with 82.0% (interquartile range [IQR] 49.3, 93.0) time-in-target range during labor and delivery and a mean glucose of 6.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u2009mmol/L (124\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u2009mg/dL). Closed loop performed well throughout vaginal, elective, and emergency cesarean section deliveries. Postpartum, women spent 83.3% (IQR 75.2, 94.6) time-in-target range (3.9-10.0\u2009mmol/L [70-180\u2009mg/dL]), with a mean glucose of 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u2009mmol/L (130\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u2009mg/dL). There was no difference in maternal glucose concentration between mothers of infants with and without neonatal hypoglycemia (6.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u2009mmol/L and 6.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009mmol/L [124\u2009\u00b1\u200929\u2009mg/dL and 122\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2009mg/dL] respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.84). Automated closed-loop insulin delivery is feasible during hospital admissions for labor, delivery, and postpartum. Larger scale studies are needed to evaluate its efficacy compared with current clinical approaches as well as understand how women and healthcare providers will adopt this technology.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether metformin add-on to the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (Met\u2009+\u2009CSII) therapy leads to a significant reduction in insulin doses required by type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients to maintain glycemic control, and an improvement in glycemic variation (GV) compared to CSII only therapy. We analyzed data from our two randomized, controlled open-label trials. Newly diagnoses T2D patients were randomized assigned to receive either CSII therapy or Met\u2009+\u2009CSII therapy for 4 weeks. Subjects were subjected to a 4-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) at the endpoint. Insulin doses and GV profiles were analyzed. The primary endpoint was differences in insulin doses and GV between the two groups. A total of 188 subjects were admitted as inpatients. Subjects in metformin add-on therapy required significantly lower total, basal and bolus insulin doses than those of control group. CGM data showed that patients in Met\u2009+\u2009CSII group exhibited significant reduction in the 24-hr mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), the standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation compared to those of control group. Our data suggest that metformin add-on to CSII therapy leads to a significant reduction in insulin doses required by T2D patients to control glycemic variations.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this randomized four-way cross-over study was to examine the effect of added protein and/or fat in standard meals with a fixed carbohydrate content on postprandial glucose control with closed-loop insulin delivery in adults with type 1 diabetes. Participants (n\u2009=\u200915) consumed breakfast meals with a fixed carbohydrate content (75\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009g) and added protein and/or fat (35\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009g): (1) carbohydrate-only (standard), (2) high protein (HP), (3) high fat (HF) and (4) high fat + protein (HFHP). The closed-loop insulin delivery algorithm generated insulin bolus and infusion rates. The addition of fat, protein or both did not impact 5-hour post-meal sensor glucose area under the curve (AUC) (main outcome), mean sensor glucose or glycaemic peak as compared with a standard meal (P\u2009>\u20090.05). However, time to glycaemic peak was delayed by 40\u2009minutes (P\u2009=\u20090.03) and 5-hour post-meal basal insulin requirements were 39% higher (P\u2009=\u20090.04) with an HFHP meal compared with a standard meal. In conclusion, in the context of closed-loop insulin delivery, protein and/or fat meal content affects the timing of postprandial glycaemic peak, insulin requirements and late glycaemic excursion, without impacting overall 5-hour AUC.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing improvement of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and of insulin pumps are paving the way for a fast implementation of artificial pancreas (AP) for type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients. The case for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients is less obvious since usually some residual beta cell function allows for simpler therapy approaches, and even multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy is not very widespread. However, the number of insulin dependent T2D patients is vastly increasing and therefore a need for understanding chances and challenges of an automated insulin therapy arises. Based on this background, this article analyzes conditions under which the use of more advanced therapeutic approaches, particularly AP, could bring a substantial improvement and should be considered as a viable therapy option.",

This was a single-center, randomized, open-label trial. Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who were receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) were recruited. After baseline data were collected, recruited patients were then randomized 1:1 to a CSII group or a MDI group. All patients were subjected to a 4-day retrospective Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). The primary endpoint was the differences of the 24-hrs mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) in patients receiving the PN therapy between the two groups. A total of 102 patients with T2D receiving PN were recruited. Patients in the CSII group had a significantly decreased mean glucose level (MBG), the standard deviation of MG (SDBG), MAGE, and the coefficient of variation (CV%) compared to those in MDI group (all P\u2009<\u20090.01). Furthermore, we found that the patients who received a bolus insulin dose required maintaining euglycemic control was gradually decreased during the PN period in both groups at the endpoint. The administration of insulin via CSII led to a significant decrease in glycemic variations in patients receiving PN.",

    "abstract": "Glucose excursion was assessed prior to and post hypoglycaemia to increase understanding of hypoglycaemia incidence and recovery during hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery. We retrospectively analysed data from 60 adults with type 1 diabetes who received, in a crossover randomized design, day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery and insulin pump therapy, the latter with or without real-time continuous glucose monitoring. Over 4-week study periods, we identified hypoglycaemic episodes, defined as sensor glucose <3.0 mmol/L, and analysed sensor glucose relative to the onset of hypoglycaemia. We identified 377 hypoglycaemic episodes during hybrid closed-loop intervention vs 662 during control intervention (P\u2009<\u2009.001), with a predominant reduction of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The slope of sensor glucose prior to hypoglycaemia was steeper during closed-loop intervention than during control intervention (P\u2009<\u2009.01), while insulin delivery was reduced (P\u2009<\u2009.01). During both day and night, participants recovered from hypoglycaemia faster when treated by closed-loop intervention. At 120\u2009minutes post hypoglycaemia, sensor glucose levels were higher during closed-loop intervention compared to the control period (P\u2009<\u2009.05). In conclusion, closed-loop intervention reduces the risk of hypoglycaemia, particularly overnight, with swift recovery from hypoglycaemia leading to higher 2-hour post-hypoglycaemia glucose levels.",

    "abstract": "Treating hyperglycemia in previously non-diabetic individuals with exogenous insulin immediately after kidney transplantation reduced the odds of developing Posttransplantation Diabetes Mellitus (PTDM) in our previous proof-of-concept clinical trial. We hypothesized that insulin-pump therapy with maximal insulin dosage during the afternoon would improve glycemic control compared to basal insulin and standard-of-care. In a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial testing insulin isophane for PTDM prevention, we added a third study arm applying continuous subcutaneous insulin lispro infusion (CSII) treatment. CSII was initiated in 24 patients aged 55\u00b112 years, without diabetes history, receiving tacrolimus. The mean daily insulin lispro dose was 9.2\u00b15.2 IU. 2.3\u00b11.1% of the total insulin dose were administered between 00:00 and 6:00, 19.5\u00b111.6% between 6:00 and 12:00, 62.3\u00b115.6% between 12:00 and 18:00 and 15.9\u00b19.1% between 18:00 and 24:00. Additional bolus injections were necessary in five patients. Mild hypoglycemia (52-60 mg/dL) occurred in two patients. During the first post-operative week glucose control in CSII patients was overall superior compared to standard-of-care as well as once-daily insulin isophane for fasting and post-supper glucose. We present an algorithm for CSII treatment in kidney transplant recipients, demonstrating similar safety and superior short-term efficacy compared to standard-of-care and once-daily insulin isophane.",

    "abstract": "Postprandial glucose control remains challenging for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A simplified meal bolus approach with a dual-hormone (insulin and glucagon) closed-loop system (DH-CLS) has been tested; yet, the impact of categorization errors with this strategy is unknown. The objective was to compare, in a randomized controlled inpatient trial, DH-CLS with the simplified meal bolus approach for two different meals properly categorized or overestimated. We tested, in patients with T1D, the simplified strategy with two standardized breakfasts (n\u2009=\u200910 per meal) adequately categorized or overestimated: (1) 75\u2009g and (2) 45\u2009g of carbohydrate. No difference was observed for percentage of time <4.0\u2009mmol/L over a 4-hour post-meal period (primary outcome; median [IQR]: 0[0-0] vs. 0[0-0] for both comparisons, p\u2009=\u20090.47 and 0.31 for the 75\u2009g and 45\u2009g meals, respectively). Despite higher meal insulin boluses with overestimation for both meals (9.2 [8.2-9.6] vs. 8.1 [7.3-9.1] U and 8.4 [7.2-10.4] vs. 4.8 [3.7-5.6] U; p\u2009<\u20090.05), mean glycemia, percentage of time in target range and glucagon infusion did not differ. Additional scenarios were tested in silico with comparable results. These results suggest that the DH-CLS with a simplified meal bolus calculation is probably able to avoid hypoglycemia in the event of meal size misclassification.",

However, reliance on automated insulin delivery potentially means patients will be slower to act when devices stop functioning appropriately. One such scenario involves an insulin infusion site failure, where the insulin that is recorded as delivered fails to affect the patient's glucose as expected. Alerting patients to these events in real time would potentially reduce hyperglycemia and ketosis associated with infusion site failures.",

We enrolled 46 patients hospitalized for an AECOPD in a multicentre double-blind randomized controlled study in which add-on treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg was compared with placebo. Glycaemic control and incidence of hypoglycaemia were measured through a blinded subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring device. Participants in the dapagliflozin group spent 54 \u00b1 27.7% of the time in target range (3.9-10 mmol/L) and participants in the placebo group spent 53.6 \u00b1 23.4% of the time in target range (P = .96). The mean glucose concentration was 10.1 mmol/L in the dapagliflozin group and 10.4 mmol/L in the placebo group (P = .66). One participant using dapagliflozin and 2 participants using placebo experienced symptomatic hypoglycaemia. Treatment with dapagliflozin was safe and there was no difference in risk of hypoglycaemia compared with placebo. Dapagliflozin did not result in better glycaemic control compared with placebo in participants with prednisone-induced hyperglycaemia during AECOPD.",

The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of the FreeStyle Navigator I in critically ill patients and to assess patient related factors influencing the accuracy and reliability. This study is a retrospective analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in a 20-bed mixed intensive care unit. Analytical accuracy, clinical accuracy and reliability were assessed against arterial blood glucose samples as reference. Assessment was according to recent consensus recommendations with median absolute relative difference (median ARD), Bland-Altman plots, the ISO system accuracy standards (ISO 15197:2013) and Clarke error grid analysis (CEG). We analyzed 2840 paired measurements from 155 critically ill patients. The median ARD of all paired values was 13.3 [6.9-22.1]%. The median ARD was significantly higher in both the hypoglycemic and the hyperglycemic range (32.4 [12.1-53.4]% and 18.7 [10.7-28.3]% respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean bias of -\u20090.82\u00a0mmol/L with a lower limit of agreement (LOA) of -\u20093.88\u00a0mmol/L and an upper LOA of 2.24\u00a0mmol/L. A total of 1626 (57.3%) values met the ISO-2013, standards and 1,334 (47%) CGM values were within 12.5% from the reference value. CEG: 71.0% zone A, 25.8% zone B, 0.5% zone C, 2.5% zone D, 0.3% zone E. The median overall real-time data display time was 94.0\u2009\u00b1\u200914.9% and in 23% of the patients, the sensor measured\u2009<\u200995% of the time. Additionally, data gaps longer than 30\u00a0min were found in 48% of the patients. The analytical accuracy of the FreeStyle Navigator I in critically ill patients was suboptimal. Furthermore, the clinical accuracy, did not meet the required standards. The reliability was satisfactory, however, in almost a quarter of the patients the realtime data display was <\u200995%. The accuracy was considerably and significantly lower in hyper- and hypoglycemic ranges.",

    "abstract": "A 3-month pivotal trial using the MiniMed\u2122 670G hybrid closed-loop (HCL) system in adolescent and adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), relative to a 2-week baseline run-in period, resulted in increased sensor glucose (SG) values in target range (71-180\u2009mg/dL), reduced HbA1c levels, and no events of diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia ( Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02463097). This brief report evaluated how prior continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) experience influenced glycemic outcomes, in the same pivotal trial. HbA1c levels and the percentage of SG values in low, high, and in-target ranges were analyzed from participants (n\u2009=\u2009124) completing the Hybrid Closed-Loop Pivotal Trial in T1D. There were 78 individuals comprising the prior CGM group and 46 comprising the no prior CGM group. Compared to baseline, HbA1c was reduced from 7.4%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9% to 6.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7% for the prior CGM group and from 7.5%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9% to 6.8%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5% for the no prior CGM group. For those with prior CGM experience, the mean percentage of in-target SG values increased from 66.9%\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5% to 72.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20099.1%, and for those with no prior CGM experience it increased from 66.6%\u2009\u00b1\u200911.7% to 71.5%\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5%. Similar improvement in glucose values in the low and high ranges, relative to baseline, was observed for both groups. Resulting outcomes, from baseline to study end, did not differ between each group. These findings suggest that individuals without prior CGM experience, and those already using CGM, will benefit similarly with use of the FDA-approved MiniMed 670G HCL system therapy.",

We evaluated 24 of our patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent BS (12 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, RYGB, and 12 single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy, SADI-S) and who were in remission after 18-24\u00a0months' follow-up. At this time, a CGM device was placed for 7\u00a0days. Patients were reevaluated thereafter for at least 5\u00a0years. Glucose variability (GV) was lower in patients after SADI-S and in the 18 patients who were still in remission after 5\u00a0years, and provided more information on long-term status than classical diabetes-related characteristics.",

For the first group: After admission, tofogliflozin 20 mg was administered; Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were titrated using an algorithm and stabilized at 80 mg/dL level with Glargine 300 for 5 days; Next, glucose levels were continuously monitored for 2 days using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM); Tofogliflozin was then washed out over 5 days; Subsequently, ipragliflozin 50 mg was administered; FPG levels were titrated using the same algorithm and stabilized at 80 mg/dL level with Glargine 300 for 5 days; Next, glucose levels were continuously monitored for 2 days using CGM. For the second group, ipragliflozin was administered prior to tofogliflozin, and the same regimen was maintained. Glargine 300 and SGLT2i were administered at 8:00 AM. Data collected on the second day of measurement (mean amplitude of glycemic excursion [MAGE], average daily risk range [ADRR]; on all days of measurement) were analyzed. Area over the glucose curve (<70 mg/dL; 0:00 to 6:00, 24-h), M value, standard deviation, MAGE, ADRR, and mean glucose levels (24-h, 8:00 to 24:00) were significantly lower in patients on tofogliflozin than in those on ipragliflozin. Tofogliflozin, which reduces glycemic variability by preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia and decreasing postprandial glucose levels, is an ideal SGLT2i when used together with Glargine 300 during basal insulin therapy.",

In a 3-week crossover trial, 10 adults with T1D were randomized to perform aerobic, resistance or no exercise. During each exercise week, participants completed 2 separate 45-minutes exercise sessions at an academic medical center. Participants returned home and wore a continuous glucose monitor and a wrist-based activity monitor to estimate sleep duration. Participants on average lost 70 (\u00b149) minutes of sleep (P\u2009=\u2009.0015) on nights following aerobic exercise and 27 (\u00b178) minutes (P\u2009=\u2009.3) following resistance exercise relative to control nights. The odds ratio with confidence intervals of nocturnal hypoglycaemia occurring on nights following aerobic and resistance exercise was 5.4 (1.3, 27.2) and 7.0 (1.7, 37.3), respectively. Aerobic exercise can cause sleep loss in T1D possibly from increased hypoglycaemia.",

Continuous moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (CON) generally lowers blood glucose (BG) levels and often leads to hypoglycemia. In comparison, circuit-based exercise (CIRC) may attenuate the drop in BG. The goal of this study is to contrast the effects of basal insulin suspension at the onset of two different forms of exercise (CON vs. CIRC).",

However, the ways of controlling day-to-day glycemic variability are unclear. We hypothesized that the durability of basal insulin plays an important role in controlling day-to-day glycemic variability in type 2 diabetes patients, and we therefore aimed to evaluate whether glargine U300, which exhibits prolonged absorption compared with glargine U100 but the same composition as glargine U100, would lead to improved day-to-day glycemic variability.",

Ten patients (4 women, insulin pump-treated, median\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [s.d.] age 48\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009years, glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 53\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u2009mmol/mol [7.0%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6%]) followed an isocaloric HCD (\u2265250\u2009g/d) for 1\u2009week and an isocaloric LCD (\u226450\u2009g/d) for 1\u2009week in random order. After each week, we downloaded pump and sensor data and collected fasting blood and urine samples. Diet adherence was high (225\u2009\u00b1\u200930 vs 47\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009g carbohydrates/d; P\u2009<\u2009.0001). Mean sensor glucose levels were similar in the two diets (7.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 vs 7.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009mmol/L; P\u2009=\u2009.99). The LCD resulted in more time with glucose values in the range of 3.9 to 10.0\u2009mmol/L (83%\u2009\u00b1\u20099% vs 72%\u2009\u00b1\u200911%; P\u2009=\u2009.02), less time with values \u22643.9\u2009mmol/L (3.3%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8% vs 8.0%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3%; P\u2009=\u2009.03), and less glucose variability (s.d. 1.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 vs 2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009mmol/L; P\u2009=\u2009.02) than the HCD. Cardiovascular markers were unaffected, while fasting glucagon, ketone and free fatty acid levels were higher at end of the LCD week than the HCD week. In conclusion, the LCD resulted in more time in euglycaemia, less time in hypoglycaemia and less glucose variability than the HCD, without altering mean glucose levels.",

The blood glucose regulation PBPK/PD model simulates the distribution and metabolization of glucose, insulin and glucagon on an organ and whole body level. The genome-scale metabolic networks in contrast describe intracellular reactions. The developed multiscale model is fitted to insulin, glucagon and glucose measurements of a 48h clinical trial featuring 6 subjects and is subsequently used to simulate (in silico) the influence of geneknockouts and drug-induced enzyme inhibitions on whole body blood glucose levels. Simulations of diabetes associated gene knockouts and impaired cellular glucose metabolism, resulted in elevated whole body blood-glucose levels, but also in a metabolic shift within the cell's reaction network. Such multiscale models have the potential to be employed in the exploration of novel drug-targets or to be integrated into control algorithms for artificial pancreas systems.",

    "abstract": "In an article in Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Freckmann et al report an evaluation of 2 infusion sets used for CSII in daily life, both from Roche. Because the 2 catheters differed at the soft cannula level in terms of geometry and introducer needle, focus was made on pain at insertion. While no significant difference was noted on this primary endpoint, unplanned catheter changes occurred in close to 20% of cases also with both catheter models, mainly driven by apparent insulin delivery issues. Since kinked cannulas were not frequent, there is a clear need for better understanding of \"unexplained hyperglycemia\" as the main reason for reduction of catheter lifetime. Fixing this weak aspect of CSII becomes crucial while moving toward closed-loop insulin delivery.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the safety and efficacy of the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor luseogliflozin with differing carbohydrate intakes in Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Participants were randomly assigned to 3 carbohydrate-adjusted meals for 14\u2009days (days 1-14; a high carbohydrate [HC; 55% total energy carbohydrate] and high glycaemic index [HGI] meal; an HC [55% total energy carbohydrate] and low glycaemic index [LGI] meal; or a low carbohydrate [LC; 40% total energy carbohydrate] and HGI meal). All participants received luseogliflozin for the last 7\u2009days (days 8-14), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) before and after luseogliflozin treatment (days 5-8 and days 12-15) and blood tests on days 1, 8 and 15. Luseogliflozin significantly decreased the area under the curve and mean of CGM values in all 3 groups similarly. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon were similar at all time points. Ketone bodies on day 15 were significantly higher in the LC-HGI group compared with the HC-HGI and HC-LGI groups. In conclusion, luseogliflozin has similar efficacy and safety in Japanese people with T2D when meals contain 40% to 55% total energy carbohydrate, but a strict LC diet on this class of drug should be avoided to prevent SGLT2 inhibitor-associated diabetic ketoacidosis.",

    "abstract": "Insulin infusion set failure resulting in prolonged hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis can occur with pump therapy in type 1 diabetes. Set failures are frequently characterized by variable and unpredictable patterns of increasing glucose values despite increased insulin infusion. Early detection may minimize the risk of prolonged hyperglycemia, an important consideration for automated insulin delivery and closed-loop applications.",

    "abstract": "Fear of hypoglycemia is a major concern for many patients with type 1 diabetes and affects patient decisions for use of an artificial pancreas system. We propose an alternative way for prevention of hypoglycemia by issuing predictive hypoglycemia alarms and encouraging patients to consume carbohydrates in a timely manner. The algorithm has been tested on 6 subjects (3 males and 3 females, age 24.2 \u00b1 4.5 years, weight 79.2 \u00b1 16.2 kg, height 172.7 \u00b1 9.4 cm, HbA1C 7.3 \u00b1 0.48%, duration of diabetes 209.2 \u00b1 87.9 months) over 3-day closed-loop clinical experiments as part of a multivariable artificial pancreas control system. Over 6 three-day clinical experiments, there were only 5 real hypoglycemia episodes, of which only 1 hypoglycemia episode occurred due to being missed by the proposed algorithm. The average hypoglycemia alarms per day and per subject was 3. Average glucose value when the first alarms were triggered was recorded to be 117 \u00b1 30.6 mg/dl. Average carbohydrate consumption per alarm was 14 \u00b1 7.8 grams. Our results have shown that most low glucose concentrations can be predicted in advance and the glucose levels can be raised back to the desired levels by consuming an appropriate amount of carbohydrate. The proposed algorithm is able to prevent most hypoglycemic events by suggesting appropriate levels of carbohydrate consumption before the actual occurrence of hypoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "Military personnel and some athlete populations endure short-term energy deficits from reduced energy intake and/or increased energy expenditure (EE) that may degrade physical and cognitive performance due to severe hypoglycemia (<3.1 mmol/l). The extent to which energy deficits alter normoglycemia (3.9-7.8 mmol/l) in healthy individuals is not known, since prior studies measured glucose infrequently, not continuously. The purpose of this study was to characterize the glycemic response to acute, severe energy deficit compared with fully fed control condition, using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). For 2 days during a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 23 volunteers (17 men/6 women; age: 21.3 \u00b1 3.0 yr; body mass index: 25 \u00b1 3 kg/m) increased habitual daily EE [2,300 \u00b1 450 kcal/day [means \u00b1 SD)] by 1,647 \u00b1 345 kcal/day through prescribed exercise (~3 h/day; 40-65% peak O",

    "abstract": "As life expectancy becomes longer in Japan, there has been an increase of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes who need insulin therapy but cannot perform self-injection due to dementia or other conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of thrice-weekly insulin degludec therapy in elderly patients with poorly controlled diabetes. The subjects were 22 hospitalized elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes who had difficulty with self-injection. After becoming stable on once-daily insulin degludec treatment, they were assigned to continue once-daily injection (OD group) or were switched to thrice-weekly injection (TW group) for one week. In the TW group, insulin degludec (IDeg) was injected at twice the OD dose before lunch on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Glycemic control was assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) over 7 days. The mean 7-day glucose level (131\u00b125 mg/dL with OD vs. 152\u00b130 mg/dL with TW, p=0.11) and the mean 7-day standard deviation (32\u00b110 mg/dL with OD vs. 36\u00b114 mg/dL with TW, p=0.45) did not differ significantly between the two groups. The percent duration of glucose <70 mg/dL (2.4\u00b13.1% with OD vs. 1.3\u00b12.5% with TW, p=0.39) and glucose >200 mg/dL (7.2\u00b112.1% with OD vs. 15.6\u00b118.0% with TW, p=0.22) over 7 days also showed no significant differences between the two groups. In conclusion, thrice-weekly IDeg provided by a visiting nurse could be a practical option for elderly diabetic patients who have difficulty performing self-injection of insulin.",

    "abstract": "Continuous exercise (CON) and high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) can be safely performed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Additionally, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems may serve as a tool to reduce the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia. It is unclear if CGM is accurate during CON and HIIE at different mean workloads. Seven T1DM patients performed CON and HIIE at 5% below (L) and above (M) the first lactate turn point (LTP\u2081), and 5% below the second lactate turn point (LTP\u2082) (H) on a cycle ergometer. Glucose was measured via CGM and in capillary blood (BG). Differences were found in comparison of CGM vs. BG in three out of the six tests (p < 0.05). In CON, bias and levels of agreement for L, M, and H were found at: 0.85 (-3.44, 5.15) mmol\u00b7L(-1), -0.45 (-3.95, 3.05) mmol\u00b7L(-1), -0.31 (-8.83, 8.20) mmol\u00b7L(-1) and at 1.17 (-2.06, 4.40) mmol\u00b7L(-1), 0.11 (-5.79, 6.01) mmol\u00b7L(-1), 1.48 (-2.60, 5.57) mmol\u00b7L(-1) in HIIE for the same intensities. Clinically-acceptable results (except for CON H) were found. CGM estimated BG to be clinically acceptable, except for CON H. Additionally, using CGM may increase avoidance of exercise-induced hypoglycemia, but usual BG control should be performed during intense exercise.",

    "abstract": "Women with type 1 diabetes strive for optimal glycemic control before and during pregnancy to avoid adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. For most women, optimal glycemic control is challenging to achieve and maintain. The aim of this study is to determine whether the use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) will improve glycemic control in women with type 1 diabetes who are pregnant or planning pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "In our previous study investigating effects of luseogliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, on 24-h glycemic variability by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), luseogliflozin elicited parallel downward shifts in fasting and postprandial glucose levels. However, further review of individual patients' data revealed that postprandial hyperglycemia was not reduced in some patients, while preprandial glucose was ameliorated in most patients. Therefore, we divided patients into two groups according to their postprandial glucose responses and conducted a post hoc subanalyses to elucidate which factors contributed to the differential effects of luseogliflozin.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of intermediate-acting insulin (IMI) titrated on body weight and glucocorticoid dose with that of short-acting sliding-scale insulin (SSI) in patients on recurrent high-dose glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy. We enrolled 26 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or random blood glucose level >12\u2009mmol/l in a previous cycle of chemotherapy in a randomized crossover study. In two consecutive cycles of glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy, participants were treated with either IMI or SSI, as add-on to routine diabetes medication. We compared time spent in target range (3.9-10\u2009mmol/l), measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and the occurrence of hypoglycaemia. IMI resulted in a higher proportion of glucose values within target range than SSI (34.4 vs 20.9%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). There were no severe or symptomatic hypoglycaemic events. Two participants in each group had a subclinical hypoglycaemia detected only by CGM. Once-daily IMI resulted in better glycaemic control than SSI in patients with glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia during chemotherapy. Safety was not compromised as the incidence of hypoglycaemia was low and not different between both regimens.",

    "abstract": "Overnight predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS) reduces hypoglycemia across all ages; however, there are no reports on behavior or experience differences across age groups, especially in pediatrics. As run-in for a subsequent randomized clinical trial (RCT), 127 subjects (50% male) ages 4-45\u2009yr utilized the experimental PLGS system nightly for 5-10 nights (PLGS active phase). We analyzed the number of blood glucose (BG) checks and boluses given per age group. During the subsequent 42 night RCT phase, we analyzed sensor use, skin reactions, errors, and reasons why the experimental system was not used. In 821 nights of active PLGS, subjects ages 4-6\u2009yr (and their parents) tested BG levels 75% of nights compared with 65% of nights (7-10\u2009yr), 53% of nights (11-14\u2009yr), 33% of nights (15-25\u2009yr), and 28% of nights (26-45\u2009yr), respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Likewise, youngest subjects (and parents) administered insulin boluses 56% of nights during active PLGS use compared with 48%, 33%, 20%, and 25%, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001). This was unrelated to study requirements. During the RCT phase, subjects 4-6\u2009yr experienced more frequent and severe skin reactions (p\u2009=\u20090.02), while adult subjects (26-45\u2009yr) wore individual sensors a median of 26\u2009h longer than the youngest subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Technical problems with the sensor (errors, miscalibrations, etc.), traveling, and BG levels >270 at bedtime (study requirement) were primary contributors to non-system use. Understanding the different use patterns and challenges in pediatrics and adolescence is needed to direct patient education to optimize use of PLGS and future artificial pancreas systems.",

    "title": "Safety, Tolerance, and Enhanced Efficacy of a Bioavailable Formulation of Curcumin With Fenugreek Dietary Fiber on Occupational Stress: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study.",
    "abstract": "Drug delivery systems capable of delivering free (unconjugated) curcuminoids is of great therapeutic significance, since the absorption of bioactive and permeable form plays a key factor in mediating the efficacy of a substance which undergoes rapid biotransformation. Considering the recent understanding on the relatively high bioactivities and blood-brain-barrier permeability of free curcuminoids over their conjugated metabolites, the present human study investigated the safety, antioxidant efficacy, and bioavailability of CurQfen (curcumagalactomannoside [CGM]), a food-grade formulation of natural curcumin with fenugreek dietary fiber that has shown to possess improved blood-brain-barrier permeability and tissue distribution in rats. In this randomized double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial, 60 subjects experiencing occupational stress-related anxiety and fatigue were randomized to receive CGM, standard curcumin, and placebo for 30 days (500 mg twice daily). The study demonstrated the safety, tolerance, and enhanced efficacy of CGM in comparison with unformulated standard curcumin. A significant improvement in the quality of life (P < 0.05) with considerable reduction in stress (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and fatigue (P < 0.001) was observed among CGM-treated subjects as compared with the standard curcumin group, when monitored by SF-36, Perceived Stress Scale with 14 items, and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores. Improvement in the quality of life was further correlated with the significant enhancement in endogenous antioxidant markers (P < 0.01) and reduction in lipid peroxidation (P < 0.001). Further comparison of the free curcuminoids bioavailability after a single-dose (500 mg once per day) and repeated-dose (500 mg twice daily for 30 days) oral administration revealed enhanced absorption and improved pharmacokinetics of CGM upon both single- (30.7-fold) and repeated-dose (39.1-fold) administrations.",

Postprandial elevation of glycaemia, insulinaemia, triglyceridaemia are associated with an increased risk of CMD.

T2DM patients were hospitalized and were randomly assigned to CSII, aspart 30-based MDI3, and glargine based MDI4. Treatments were maintained for 2-3 weeks after the glycaemic target was reached. After completing the baseline assessment, 6-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed before and after completion of insulin treatment. Treatment with CSII provided a greater improvement of blood glucose fluctuations than MDI (MDI3 or MDI4) therapy either in newly diagnosed or in long-standing T2DM patients. In long-standing diabetes patients, the MDI4 treatment group had significantly greater improvement of mean amplitude glycemic excursion (MAGE) than the MDI3 treatment group. However, in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, there were no significant differences in the improvement of MAGE between MDI3 and MDI4 groups. Glargine based MDI4 therapy provided better glucose fluctuations than aspart 30-based MDI3 therapy, especially in long-standing T2DM patients, if CSII therapy was not available.",

However, it also offers the possibility of testing new insulin analogs and alternative routes of delivery given that subcutaneous insulin administration present significant delays & variability. Inhaled insulin appears an important candidate to improve post-prandial glucose control given its rapid appearance in plasma. In this contribution, we present the results of incorporating a pharmacokinetic model of inhaled Technosphere(\u00ae) Insulin (TI) into the T1DM simulator. In particular, we successfully reproduced in silico the post-prandial glucose control observed in T1DM subjects treated with TI given at meal time, and the post-prandial glucose dynamics in response to different timing of TI dose.",

    "abstract": "Although we have used an intravenous continuous glucose monitor for blood glucose management, a previous study reported that a subcutaneous continuous glucose monitor was also reliable for use in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to compare the subcutaneous and intravenous continuous glucose monitors. This was an observational trial (UMIN-CTR, ID:000013338). We included patients who were admitted to our intensive care units (ICU) after hepato-biliary pancreatic surgery. Continuous blood glucose measurement was performed from the beginning of the operation to ICU discharge using the intravenous continuous monitor STG-55 (Nikkiso, Tokyo, Japan) and the subcutaneous continuous monitor iPro2 (Medtronic Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The STG-55 measured the glucose level in real time, and the iPro2 measured this every 5\u00a0min. We compared glucose levels obtained using the two devices every 5\u00a0min using a Bland-Altman plot and a regression analyses. A total of 3592 comparative samples in 15 cases were analyzed. The mean glucose level measured using the STG-55 was 139\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021\u00a0mg/dl, and that measured using the iPro2 was 144\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031\u00a0mg/dl. A linear regression line had the equation of the form y\u00a0=\u00a00.225x\u00a0+\u00a0106. The coefficient of determination was 0.11, and the F-test significance level was set as p\u00a0<\u00a00.01. The mean of the differences was -5.2\u00a0mg/dl, with a 95\u00a0% agreement limit of -67 to\u00a0+\u00a057\u00a0mg/dL. The percent error was 44\u00a0%. In conclusion, the current study suggests that subcutaneous and intravenous continuous glucose monitoring was not highly correlated during either surgery or ICU stay.",

    "abstract": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was the first to determine the effects of luseogliflozin in combination with a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) on 24-h glucose variability, assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). A total of 18 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized into two groups, in which patients first received luseogliflozin 2.5\u2009mg once daily then placebo for 8\u2009days each, or vice versa. Patients took luseogliflozin or placebo with a normal-carbohydrate diet (NCD) on day 7 and with the LCD on day 8. CGM was performed on both days. Luseogliflozin significantly reduced glucose exposure in terms of the area under the curve over the course of 24\u2009h when administered with the NCD (difference vs placebo: -555.6\u2009mg/dl\u00b7h [1\u2009mg/dl\u2009=\u20090.0556\u2009mmol/l]; p\u2009<\u20090.001) or with the LCD (-660.7\u2009mg/dl\u00b7h; p\u2009<\u20090.001). No hypoglycaemia was observed over 24\u2009h with either diet. Although glucose levels were lower with the LCD than with the NCD in the placebo treatment period, luseogliflozin with the LCD improved glycaemic control throughout the day to nearly the same extent as luseogliflozin with the NCD, without inducing hypoglycaemia.",

    "abstract": "Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) may relieve the pain of chronic pancreatitis while avoiding postsurgical diabetes. Minimizing hyperglycemia after TPIAT limits beta cell apoptosis during islet engraftment. Closed-loop (CL) therapy combining an insulin pump with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) has not been investigated previously in islet transplant recipients. Our objective was to determine the feasibility and efficacy of CL therapy to maintain glucose profiles close to normoglycemia following TPIAT. Fourteen adult subjects (36% male; aged 35.9\u2009\u00b1\u200911.4 years) were randomized to subcutaneous insulin via CL pump (n\u2009=\u20097) or multiple daily injections with blinded CGM (n\u2009=\u20097) for 72\u2009h at transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin. Mean serum glucose values were significantly lower in the CL pump group than in the control group (111\u2009\u00b1\u20094 vs. 130\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u2009mg/dL; p\u2009=\u20090.003) without increased risk of hypoglycemia (percentage of time <70\u2009mg/dL: CL pump 1.9%, control 4.8%; p\u2009=\u20090.46). Results from this pilot study suggest that CL therapy is superior to conventional therapy in maintaining euglycemia without increased hypoglycemia. This technology shows significant promise to safely maintain euglycemic targets during the period of islet engraftment following islet transplantation.",

Chronic subcutaneous infusion of kisspeptin via a pump (similar to an insulin pump) may provide an alternative route of administration in the future. We investigated for the first time in humans, the gonadotrophin response to subcutaneous (SC) infusions of kisspeptin-54 in healthy women. Women are markedly more responsive to exogenous kisspeptin in the late follicular phase preovulation when oestradiol levels are naturally high. Therefore, we further investigated whether there was a correlation between baseline oestradiol levels and LH response to kisspeptin.",

However, without proper management, it can lead to higher risk for hypoglycemia and impaired glycemic control. In this work, we identify the main factors explaining the blood glucose dynamics during exercise in T1D. We then propose a prediction model to quantify the glycemic drop induced by a mild to moderate physical activity.",

However, many patients use the catheters longer for economic reasons. We performed this study to investigate the tolerability of 2-day use of infusion sets in comparison to 4-day use in a real-world setting.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon use in artificial pancreas for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is being explored for prevention and rescue from hypoglycemia. However, the relationship between glucagon stimulation of endogenous glucose production (EGP) viz., hepatic glucagon sensitivity, and prevailing glucose concentrations has not been examined. To test the hypothesis that glucagon sensitivity is increased at hypoglycemia vs. euglycemia, we studied 29 subjects with T1D randomized to a hypoglycemia or euglycemia clamp. Each subject was studied at three glucagon doses at euglycemia or hypoglycemia, with EGP measured by isotope dilution technique. The peak EGP increments and the integrated EGP response increased with increasing glucagon dose during euglycemia and hypoglycemia. However, the difference in dose response based on glycemia was not significant despite higher catecholamine concentrations in the hypoglycemia group. Knowledge of glucagon's effects on EGP was used to develop an in silico glucagon action model. The model-derived output fitted the obtained data at both euglycemia and hypoglycemia for all glucagon doses tested. Glucagon clearance did not differ between glucagon doses studied in both groups. Therefore, the glucagon controller of a dual hormone control system may not need to adjust glucagon sensitivity, and hence glucagon dosing, based on glucose concentrations during euglycemia and hypoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "In this work we present a low cost, minimally invasive, and chip-based near infrared (NIR) sensor, combined with subcutaneous microdialysis, for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). The sensor principle is based on difference absorption spectroscopy in the 1st overtone band known to be dominated by glucose-specific absorption features. The device comprises a multi-emitter LED and InGaAs-photodiodes, which are located on a single electronic board (non-disposable part), connected to a personal computer via Bluetooth. The disposable part consists of a chip containing the fluidic connections for microdialysis, two fluidic channels acting as optical transmission cells and total internally reflecting mirrors for in- and out-coupling of the light to the chip and to the detectors. The use of the sensor in conjunction with a subcutaneous microdialysis catheter to separate the glucose from the cells and proteins has been demonstrated to be extremely useful and advantageous for obtaining continuous glucose monitoring data and detecting glycemic levels in real time for a long period. Several in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to test the reliability of the device. In vitro measurements showed a linear relationship between glucose concentration and the integrated difference signal with a coefficient of determination of 99 % at the physiological concentration range. Clinical trial on 6 subjects with Type 1 diabetes showed that the NIR-CGM sensor data reflects the blood reference values adequately, if a proper calibration and signal drift compensation is applied. The MARD (mean absolute relative difference) value taken on retrospective data over all subjects is 8.5 % (range 6-11.5 %).",

    "abstract": "To determine the effects of exercise on postprandial glucose metabolism and insulin action in type 1 diabetes (T1D), we applied the triple tracer technique to study 16 T1D subjects on insulin pump therapy before, during, and after 75 min of moderate-intensity exercise (50% V\u0307o2max) that started 120 min after a mixed meal containing 75 g of labeled glucose. Prandial insulin bolus was administered as per each subject's customary insulin/carbohydrate ratio adjusted for meal time meter glucose and the level of physical activity. Basal insulin infusion rates were not altered. There were no episodes of hypoglycemia during the study. Plasma dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations rose during exercise. During exercise, rates of endogenous glucose production rose rapidly to baseline levels despite high circulating insulin and glucose concentrations. Interestingly, plasma insulin concentrations increased during exercise despite no changes in insulin pump infusion rates, implying increased mobilization of insulin from subcutaneous depots. Glucagon concentrations rose before and during exercise. Therapeutic approaches for T1D management during exercise will need to account for its effects on glucose turnover, insulin mobilization, glucagon, and sympathetic response and possibly other blood-borne feedback and afferent reflex mechanisms to improve both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.",

    "abstract": "The combination of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor and a long-acting insulin analogue is widely used in clinical practice. However, some patients fail to achieve lower postprandial hyperglycemia. Mitiglinide, a short-acting insulinotropic sulfonylurea receptor ligand, is effective for postprandial hyperglycemia. Recently, it has been reported that the combination therapy of mitiglinide with a DPP-4 inhibitor could improve glycemic control. However, the efficacy of those under long-acting insulin analogue therapy remains to be investigated. Thus, we conducted a prospective single-center study of eight Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving mitiglinide added to the combination therapy of sitagliptin and insulin glargine, and evaluated its efficacy and safety by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Participants' (four men and four women) mean age was 70.3 \u00b1 10.6 years. Their mean body mass index, HbA1c level, and urinary C-peptide level were 22.0 \u00b1 2.8 kg/m(2), 9.2 \u00b1 1.2%, and 50.0 \u00b1 31.4 \u03bcg/day, respectively. CGM showed that as compared with the combination of only sitagliptin and insulin glargine, mitiglinide in combination with sitagliptin and insulin glargine significantly reduced glycemic fluctuation indices, total area for the range of 24-h glycemic fluctuations (p = 0.04), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (p = 0.03), and the proportion of time in hyperglycemia (p = 0.02) without significant difference in the proportion of time in hypoglycemia (p = 0.18). Hence, we have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the add-on treatment with mitiglinide in type 2 diabetic patients, receiving the combination therapy of sitagliptin and insulin glargine.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that use of integrated automated bolus advisors (BAs) provides significant benefits to individuals using insulin pump devices, including improved glycemic control and greater treatment satisfaction. Within the past few years, BA devices have been developed specifically for individuals treated with multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) therapy; however, many clinicians who treat these individuals may be unfamiliar with insulin pump therapy and, thus, BA use. Findings from the Automated Bolus Advisor Control and Usability Study (ABACUS) revealed that BA use can be efficacious and clinically meaningful in MDI therapy, and that most patients are willing and able to use this technology appropriately when adequate clinical support is provided. The purpose of this article is to review key learnings from ABACUS and provide practical advice for initiating BA use and monitoring therapy.",

    "abstract": "Systems for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) have been available for a number of years, and numerous clinical studies have been performed with them. Interestingly, in many of these studies patients with an increased risk of hypoglycemic events were excluded. In addition, in most studies subjects were using a pump for insulin delivery. Therefore our knowledge about the benefit of CGM in patients employing multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin is limited, especially when it comes to a reduction in the risk of low glucose events in high-risk individuals. We are planning to run a 26-week randomized controlled study in Germany (HypoDE, Hypoglycemia in Deutschland) that is focused on evaluating if such a reduction can be observed in patients on MDI with an increased risk of low glucose events. In all, 160 patients will participate in the study, randomized into the intervention group and control group. Ideally one would study if the frequency of severe hypoglycemic events is different between both groups. However, this would require such a large sample size and study duration, so for pragmatic reasons we will use low glucose levels <55 mg/dl (measured by CGM) for at least 20 minutes as a risk marker for severe hypoglycemic events. The results from the HypoDE study shall help determine the advantage of using CGM in subjects with type 1 diabetes with an increased risk of low glucose events treated with MDI.",

In outpatient studies these control metrics can be computed only from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor data, with the risk of an unfair assessment because of their inaccuracy. The aim of the present article is to show that the control metrics can be much more accurately determined if CGM data are preprocessed by a recently proposed retrofitting algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The use of sensor-augmented insulin pump (SAP) therapy is increasing. Currently, glucose sensors and insulin infusion cannulas are inserted separately. A new device, MiniMed Duo, combines sensing and infusion capabilities on the same platform and is intended to simplify device insertion and site management. We evaluated the device's performance with respect to insulin delivery and glucose sensing, and its acceptability with patients. Forty-five patients (mean \u00b1 SD age, 45.5 \u00b1 10.9 years, 48% female) with type 1 diabetes and previous use of SAP participated. Each subject was to wear 5 devices connected to insulin pumps over 15 days (3 days/device) and test capillary blood glucose (SMBG) 7 times/day. The primary endpoint was the percentage of sensor-SMBG paired values within 20% of one another. Subject experiences were assessed via questionnaires. Overall, 74.8% of sensor-SMBG paired values were within 20%, meeting the primary accuracy endpoint, and the mean absolute relative difference was 15.5 \u00b1 17.1%. Consensus error grid analysis showed that >95% of points were within the A+B zones, exceeding the threshold for adequate clinical accuracy. Insulin dosage and SMBG values did not change significantly compared to prestudy values. The functional survival of the device entering day 3 was 90.5%. There were no serious adverse events. Mean questionnaire results indicated overall satisfaction with the device. Duo provided insulin infusion and glucose sensing capabilities in a single device, which provided accurate glucose readings during routine use, was safe to wear, and was acceptable to most patients. It may improve satisfaction and convenience for patients using sensor-augmented insulin pumps.",

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is becoming popular as a tool for educators and families to improve glycemic control. CGM can be a valuable educational tool to demonstrate to the user the impact of insulin dosing and effects of physical activity, food intake, and other life events such as work, illness, and stress on their glycemic control. The authors will share education tips and practical applications for diabetes educators to facilitate education and sustained use of Enlite glucose sensors in children and adolescents using insulin pump therapy.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the performance of a modified Dexcom G4 Platinum system with an advanced algorithm, in comparison with frequent venous samples measured on a laboratory reference (YSI) during a clinic session and in comparison to self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) during home use. Fifty-one subjects with diabetes were enrolled in a prospective multicenter study. Subjects wore 1 sensor for 7-day use and participated in one 12-hour in-clinic session on day 1, 4, or 7 to collect YSI reference venous glucose every 15 minutes and capillary SMBG test every 30 minutes. Carbohydrate consumption and insulin dosing and timing were manipulated to obtain data in low and high glucose ranges. In comparison with the laboratory reference method (n = 2,263) the system provided a mean and median absolute relative differences (ARD) of 9.0% and 7.0%, respectively. The mean absolute difference for CGM was 6.4 mg/dL when the YSIs were within hypoglycemia ranges (\u2264 70 mg/dL). The percentage in the clinically accurate Clarke error grid A zone was 92.4% and in the benign error B zone was 7.1%. Majority of the sensors (73%) had an aggregated MARD in reference to YSI \u2264 10%. The MARD of CGM-SMBG for home use was 11.3%. The study showed that the point and rate accuracy, clinical accuracy, reliability, and consistency over the duration of wear and across glycemic ranges were superior to current commercial real-time CGM systems. The performance of this CGM is reaching that of a self-monitoring blood glucose meter in real use environment.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if there were usability and training differences between the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm Revel Insulin Pump and the Tandem Diabetes Care t:slim Insulin Pump during use by representative users, performing representative tasks, in a simulated use environment. This study utilized a between-subjects experimental design with a total of 72 participants from 5 sites across the United States. Study participants were randomized to either the Revel pump group or the t:slim Pump group. Participants were 18 years of age or older and managed their diabetes using multiple daily insulin injections. Dependent variables included training time, training satisfaction, time on task, task failures, System Usability Scale (SUS) ratings, perceived task difficulty, and a pump survey that measured different aspects of the pumps and training sessions. There was a statistically significant difference in training times and error rates between the t:slim and Revel groups. The training time difference represented a 27% reduction in time to train on the t:slim versus the Revel pump. There was a 65% reduction in participants' use error rates between the t:slim and the Revel group. The t:slim Pump had statistically significant training and usability advantages over the Revel pump. The reduction in training time may have been a result of an optimized information architecture, an intuitive navigational layout, and an easy-to-read screen. The reduction in use errors with the t:slim may have been a result of dynamic error handling and active confirmation screens, which may have prevented programming errors.",

    "abstract": "The premise of effective closed-loop insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) relies on the accuracy of continuous interstitial fluid glucose sensing that represents the crucial afferent arm of such a system. An important determinant of sensor accuracy is the physiological time lag of glucose transport from the vascular to the interstitial space. The purpose of current studies was to determine the physiological time lag of glucose transport from the vascular to the abdominal subcutaneous interstitial space in T1D. Four microdialysis catheters were inserted into the abdominal subcutaneous space in 6 T1D subjects under overnight fasted conditions. Plasma glucose was maintained at 113.7 \u00b1 6.3 mg/dl using a continuous intravenous insulin infusion. After sequential intravenous bolus administrations of glucose isotopes, timed plasma and interstitial fluid samples were collected chronologically and analyzed for tracer enrichments. We observed a median (range) time lag of tracer appearance (time to detection) into the interstitial space after intravenous bolus of 6.8 (4.8-9.8) minutes, with all participants having detectable values by 9.8 minutes. We conclude that in the overnight fasted state in T1D adults, the delay of glucose appearance from the vascular to the interstitial space is less than 10 minutes, thereby implying that this minimal physiological time lag should not be a major impediment to the development of an effective closed-loop control system for T1D.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the impact of perceived insulin pump usability on attitudes toward insulin pump therapy in diabetic individuals currently treated with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI). This comparative, single-arm study recruited 28 adults with type 1 (n = 16) and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (n = 12) to evaluate 2 current insulin pumps: Medtronic Revel 723 (Pump 1), Asante Snap Insulin Pump (Pump 2). Participants were randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 assessment sequences: Pump 1 followed by Pump 2; and Pump 2 followed by Pump 1. Structured observational protocols were utilized to assess participants' ability and time required to learn/perform common tasks associated with pump setup/use. Participants used a modified version of the System Usability Scale (SUS) and investigator-developed questionnaires to rate pump usability and task difficulty; pre-post questionnaires assessed changes in attitudes toward insulin pump therapy. All participants completed the study. SUS scores showed Pump 2 to be more usable than Pump 1 on all usability attributes. Participants rated Pump 2 more positively than Pump 1, overall mean SUS scores of 5.7 versus 4.1 respectively, F(1, 52) = 32.7, P < .001, and SUS scores were higher if participants used the Pump 2 last, 5.3 versus 4.4 for Pump 1 last, F(1, 52) = 10.8, P < .01. Pump 2 was preferred for all tasks: manual bolus (86%), bolus calculation (71%), managing basal rates (93%), interpreting alarms (96%), transferring settings (100%), changing insulin and infusion sets (93%), all P < .05. Perceptions of pump usability can directly impact acceptance and use of features that may benefit those who wear them. Simpler pump devices that decrease perceptions of complexity may encourage broader use of this technology.",

    "abstract": "Exercise-associated hypoglycemia is a common adverse event in people with type 1 diabetes. Previous in silico testing by our group demonstrated superior exercise-associated hypoglycemia mitigation when a predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS) algorithm was augmented to incorporate activity data. The current study investigates the effectiveness of an accelerometer-augmented PLGS algorithm in an outpatient exercise protocol. Subjects with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy participated in two structured soccer sessions, one utilizing the algorithm and the other using the subject's regular basal insulin rate. Each subject wore their own insulin pump and a Dexcom G4\u2122 Platinum continuous glucose monitor (CGM); subjects on-algorithm also wore a Zephyr BioHarness\u2122 3 accelerometer. The algorithm utilized a Kalman filter with a 30-minute prediction horizon. Activity and CGM readings were manually entered into a spreadsheet and at five-minute intervals, the algorithm indicated whether the basal insulin infusion should be on or suspended; any changes were then implemented by study staff. The rate of hypoglycemia during and after exercise (until the following morning) was compared between groups. Eighteen subjects (mean age 13.4 \u00b1 3.7 years) participated in two separate sessions 7-22 days apart. The difference in meter blood glucose levels between groups at each rest period did not achieve statistical significance at any time point. Hypoglycemia during the session was recorded in three on-algorithm subjects, compared to six off-algorithm subjects. In the postexercise monitoring period, hypoglycemia occurred in two subjects who were on-algorithm during the session and four subjects who were off-algorithm. The accelerometer-augmented algorithm failed to prevent exercise-associated hypoglycemia compared to subjects on their usual basal rates. A larger sample size may have achieved statistical significance. Further research involving an automated system, a larger sample size, and an algorithm design that favors longer periods of pump suspension is necessary.",

    "abstract": "We have previously tested, in a laboratory setting, a novel algorithm that enables prediction of hypoglycemia. The algorithm integrates information of autonomic modulation, based on heart rate variability (HRV), and data based on a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device. Now, we investigate whether the algorithm is suitable for prediction of hypoglycemia and for improvement of hypoglycemic detection during normal daily activities. Twenty-one adults (13 men) with T1D prone to hypoglycemia were recruited and monitored with CGM and a Holter device while they performed normal daily activities. We used our developed algorithm (a pattern classification method) to predict spontaneous hypoglycemia based on CGM and HRV. We compared 3 different models; (i) a model containing raw data from the CGM device; (ii) a CGM* model containing data derived from the CGM device signal; and (iii) a CGM+HRV model-combining model (ii) with HRV data. A total of 12 hypoglycemic events (glucose levels < 3.9 mmol/L, 70 mg/dL) and 237 euglycemic measurements were included. For a 20-minute prediction, model (i) resulted in a ROC AUC of 0.69. If a high sensitivity of 100% was chosen, the corresponding specificity was 69%. (ii) The CGM* model yielded a ROC AUC of 0.92 with a corresponding sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 71%. (iii) The CGM+HRV model yielded a ROC AUC of 0.96 with a corresponding sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91%. Data shows that adding information of autonomic modulation to CGM measurements enables prediction and improves the detection of hypoglycemia.",
